they crawled through the hole and came out in a big chamber
it was dark and cold and dusty
but when they turned around , they saw that the hole was gone
it was covered by a big stone that fell from the ceiling
they were trapped in the chamber
they cried and hugged each other
they wished they had not gone in the chamber
they wished they had listened to sue
then they heard a sound
it was a voice
it was their friend ben
he had seen them go in the hole and followed them
he had seen the stone fall and blocked the hole
he had looked for another way to get to them
he ran to get a rope and a flashlight
he came back and threw the rope through the window

she gasps
" oh , no ! " tom says
he puts his cup down and gets a napkin
he tries to help mia wipe the juice off her dress
but the napkin is too small

" you are very pretty
the dog nods and licks anna 's hand
ben is scared of the dog
" ben , do n't be afraid , " anna says
" the dog is nice

" look , anna , a purse ! " ben says
ben runs to the bench and grabs the purse
" wow , this is a great purse ! " ben says
the dog barks and runs after ben
the dog wants the purse too
the dog jumps on ben and knocks him down

the dog picks up the cookie with its mouth and eats it

anna comes to help ben
she sees a lady running towards them
the lady is wearing a blue dress and a hat

" i 'm sorry , kids , he took my purse
the lady takes the purse and the whistle from the dog
" here , you can have these , " the lady says
" i 'm sorry for the trouble
the lady puts the bow back on the dog 's neck and walks away
" bye , dog ! " anna says
" you are very funny
ben is still angry
he does not like the dog
he does not like the ball
" anna , let 's go home , " ben says
anna nods and follows ben
she likes the cookie
she likes the dog
she thinks the purse is too big for her
lily and ben were excited to go to the lake with their dad
they liked to swim , splash and play with the fish
" look , dad , i found a big log ! " ben shouted , dragging a long piece of wood to the shore
" sure , ben , that 's a great log for a boat
lily ran to help ben with the log
she saw a blue towel and a stick nearby
" i have an idea , ben
we can use this towel as a sail and this stick as a mast
" wow , lily , you are very smart
that 's a good idea
they worked together to make the boat
they tied the rope around the log and the stick
they attached the towel to the stick with some knots
" yes , i 'm ready , lily
they lifted the boat and carried it to the edge of the lake
they counted to three and pushed the boat into the water
" wow , you two , you made a wonderful boat

" the wind is strong
" maybe the string is too short , " lily says

they see a problem
the kite has a hole in it
the wind goes through the hole
" oh no , the kite is broken , " tom says
" maybe we can use a patch , " lily says
" or some tape
they look for something to fix the kite
they see a big leaf
it is brown and dry
they take the leaf
they put it on the hole
they use some grass to tie it
they try to fly the kite again
they run and run
the kite goes up
it hangs in the air
it moves with the wind
" yay , we did it ! " tom says
" the kite is flying
" yay , we are so smart ! " lily says
" the leaf is a good patch
they laugh and clap
they watch the kite
but then , something bad happens
the wind gets stronger
it blows harder
it pulls the kite
the string breaks

" the wind took it
" uh oh , that is sad , " lily says
" the kite was ours

" hello , kids , " he says
" is this your kite ? i saw it flying in the sky
it is a nice kite
but it has a hole in it
and a leaf on it

" the kite was broken
we tried to fix it
but the wind was too strong
it broke the string
" yes , sir , " lily says
" we were scared
we thought we lost it
we were sad
" you 're welcome , kids , " he says
" you are very clever
you used a leaf to patch the hole
that is a good idea
but you need a stronger string
and a smaller hole
" yes , please , " tom and lily say
" we want to fly the kite again
" okay , then , " he says
" let 's go to my house
i have some tools and materials
we can fix the kite together

he saw a big shadow above him
he swam up to meet it
he thought it was a friend
but it was a shark ! the shark had sharp teeth and a hungry look
but the shark was faster and chased him
the fish saw a small hole in a rock
he swam inside and hid
the shark could not fit in the hole

he learned that the deep sea can be dangerous
he was glad that he had a safe home in the rock
