they decide to share the blocks and build a new tower together
they have fun and play nicely
they had many toys and books and a big bed with soft cushions
one day , they found a new game
they took the cushions and piled them up on the floor
then they climbed on the bed and jumped on the cushions
they laughed and shouted as they bounced up and down
she came to their room and saw the mess
she was angry and told them to stop jumping and clean up
you 're making too much noise and you 're ruining the cushions
they 're not for jumping , they 're for sleeping
now come on , or you 'll be in trouble
" mom said , grabbing their hands and pulling them away from the bed
they did not want to eat or nap
they wanted to play
they thought their mom was mean and unfair
they did not say thank you or sorry
they pouted and whined all the way to the kitchen
the cushions were torn and ripped
the stuffing was everywhere
their toys and books were broken and dirty
and on the wall , there was a big scratch and a note
it said : " i 'm a mighty lion too
and i do n't like noisy kids
next time , be quiet and listen to your mom
or i 'll come back and eat you
grrr ! "
he was hiding under the bed , looking smug and satisfied
he had heard them jumping and roaring and had decided to join the game
but he had played too rough and had destroyed everything
they cried and hugged each other
they wished they had listened to their mom and not jumped on the cushions
they learned their lesson the hard way
they realized that their mom was right and that they had been wrong
they said sorry to their mom and to each other
they helped her clean up the mess and promised to be good and quiet from then on
they hoped that fluffy would not come back and eat them
they hoped that their mom would forgive them and love them still
they hoped that their cushions would be fixed and their toys and books would be replaced
they hoped that they would find a new game that was fun and safe and did not make anyone angry or sad
they saw a big green apple on a tree
lily wanted to eat it , but ben wanted to throw it
i want to play with it , " ben said
it is my apple
i want to eat it
it is yummy , " lily said
the apple broke in half
they both dropped the pieces
a squirrel ran and took the other piece
the bird and the squirrel are happy
they like the apple , " ben said
maybe we can share with them , " lily said
they went to find more apples to share
they had many marbles of different colors and sizes
they liked to roll them and make them hit each other
it is mighty
it can knock down all your marbles , " ben said
he rolled his red marble and hit lily 's blue marble
lily 's blue marble rolled away
you should share your marbles and play fair , " lily said
she was sad and angry
i want to win
my red marble is the best , " ben said
he rolled his red marble again and hit lily 's green marble
lily 's green marble rolled away
it was a small yellow marble
she did not think it was mighty
she thought it was weak
she wanted to cry
she picked up her yellow marble and poked ben 's red marble with it
ben 's red marble did not roll
it cracked
that is not fair , " ben said
he was shocked and sad
you said it was mighty , but it was not
it was fragile
you should not be mean and boastful
you should be kind and humble , " lily said
she felt sorry for ben , but also proud of her yellow marble
he realized that he was wrong
he said sorry to lily and asked her to be his friend
lily smiled and said yes
they hugged and shared their marbles
they learned that size and color do not matter
what matters is how you treat others

they saw a big hill with a lot of trees
they wanted to discover what was on the other side
" maybe we can find a treasure or a secret cave ! "
" but be careful
it looks dark and spooky over there
they heard a loud noise
it was the wind
it was blowing hard and making the trees shake and the leaves fly
" it 's so strong and fast ! "
she did not like the wind
it made her cold and it made her hair go in her eyes
she wanted to go back to the park
" can we go back , please ? "
he saw that she was scared
he wanted to make her feel better
" we can go back
but first , let 's do something fun
let 's make a kite ! "
he tied the bag to the stick with a string
he gave it to lily
" this is a kite
you can hold it and let the wind lift it up
it will fly like a bird ! "
she felt curious
she wanted to try it
" how do i make it fly ? "
they ran down the hill , laughing and shouting
the kite flew high in the sky , dancing with the wind
she liked the kite
she liked the wind
she was not scared anymore
you made me discover something new and fun
i love you
you are the best , too
you made me discover something new and sweet
he thinks it is a shiny toy that makes his dad 's face smooth
he waits for his dad to go to work , then he sneaks into the bathroom and takes the razor from the drawer
he rubs it with a cloth until it sparkles
it is a big mirror that shows him and the razor
he wonders what will happen if he touches the razor to his face
he thinks it will make him look like his dad
he lifts the razor and moves it closer to his cheek
it is sharp and hurts tom
he feels a sting and sees red on his face and on the mirror
he drops the razor and starts to cry

he does not want to polish the razor anymore
he says he is sorry to his mom and his dad
he learns his lesson and plays with his safe toys instead

he loves his dad and his dad loves him , even with a band - aid on his face
they liked to play with toys and eat snacks
one day , they found a big bag of prunes in the kitchen
they thought prunes were yummy and sweet
they put them in their mouths and chewed
but the prunes were not yummy and sweet
they were dry and sour and bitter
they made their faces twist and their tongues hurt
" these prunes are stupid ! "
" they are bad ! "
they were angry and sad
they wanted something good to eat
it was white and pink and had candles on it
it looked yummy and sweet
they put it in their mouths and smiled
it was yummy and sweet
it made their faces happy and their tongues glad
" this cake is good ! "
" it is nice ! "
they did not care about the prunes

it said : " happy birthday , mom ! do not touch the cake ! "
they felt full and sick
they clapped their hands and laughed
they thought they were clever and funny
they were naughty and rude
they did not know that mom was coming home soon
they did not know that mom loved cake and wanted to share it with them
they did not know that mom would be very angry and sad when she saw what they did
she learned sign from her teacher at school
she had many friends who also signed
anna was deaf , but she was not sad

she saw a boy in front of her
he had curly hair and a red shirt

he pointed at his mouth and shook his head
he did not sign
he did not understand anna
he was ignorant

it 's good to say thank you to the things and people that make you happy

like the fly
you tried to help the fly , did n't you ? " lily nodded and said , " yes , mom
but the fly was dead
i could not make it alive

lily 's skin is not boring
it is beautiful , like a flower
and my skin is not weird
it is cool , like chocolate
we have different skin , but we are both good

lila was scared and cried
" no , no , that is mine ! give it back ! " she shouted
tom tried to help her and threw a stick at the dog
but the dog did not care and ran away with the doll
they saw the dog go into a house

his crown flew off his head and rolled away
he hurt his knee and his nose
he cried out loud
she saw his crown and picked it up
she ran to him and gave it back
are you okay ? " she asked
it was dirty and bent

he felt miserable
it is not shiny and pretty anymore
the other kings and queens will laugh at me
i do n't want to go to the party anymore , " he said
she smiled and said , " do n't be sad , sir
your crown is not the most important thing
you are still a king
you have a big heart and a kind voice
you can make people happy and help them
that is what makes you a good king
the other kings and queens will like you for who you are , not for what you wear
he wiped his tears and smiled back
he realized she was right
he thanked her and hugged her

she makes a face and pushes her bowl away
it is good for you , " mom says
it is hot and wet and yucky , " anna says
cheese is yummy and soft and yellow , " dad says
he shows anna how to cut the cheese with his fork
it is big and shiny and has four teeth
she likes dad 's fork

he gives anna her fork
it is not as big or shiny as dad 's fork
it has three teeth and a pink handle
she does not like her fork
it is small and dull and has a silly color

she gave him the doll
he liked it very much
he wanted to keep it
he had an idea
" you can have my car
it is fast and shiny
she shook her head
i want my doll back , " she said
he ran away with the doll
he hid it behind a bush
he thought lily would not find it
she wept
she looked for her doll
she could not see it
that is not nice , " she cried
he was happy with the doll
he did not care about lily
she wanted her doll
she wanted her friend
she came to the garden
she saw lily weeping
she saw ben hiding
he traded it for his car
he hid it
i want my doll , " lily sobbed
she went to ben
she found the doll behind the bush
you should not take lily 's doll
you should not trade without asking
you should not hide things
you should say sorry , " the grown - up said
he knew he was wrong
he gave the doll back to lily
i was mean
can we be friends again ? " he said
she hugged her doll
she hugged ben
we can be friends again
but next time , ask before you trade , " she said
she was glad they made up
she gave them a cookie each
they played with their toys
they shared and took turns
they were happy
the big house had many rooms and doors and stairs
one day , they found a new door that was locked
they wanted to see what was inside
then they saw a hole in the wall
it was big enough for them to crawl through
sue followed him , because she did not want to be alone
they crawled through the hole and came out in a big chamber
it was dark and cold and dusty
there were many things in the chamber , but they were old and broken and dirty
it was covered by a big stone that fell from the ceiling
they were trapped in the chamber
they were helpless
they wished they had not gone in the chamber
they wished they had listened to sue
they were sorry for being naughty and curious
it was a voice
it was coming from a small window in the wall
he had seen them go in the hole and followed them
he had seen the stone fall and blocked the hole
he had looked for another way to get to them
he had found the window
he came back and threw the rope through the window
he told tom and sue to tie it around their waists
he pulled them out one by one
he gave them the flashlight and hugged them
they thanked ben for saving them
they said they were sorry for being foolish and reckless
they said they learned their lesson
they said they would never go in the chamber again
they said they would always listen to their friend
i am glad you are safe
you are my friends
friends help each other
friends solve problems together
friends are good
they liked to make noises and pretend they were driving on the road
lily had a red truck and sam had a blue truck
there , they saw a big sign that said " lemonade for sale "
it was made by their neighbor , ben , who had a table with a pitcher and some cups
he had a big yellow hat and a green apron
lily and sam took a sip and made a face
the lemonade was very sour !
he had worked hard to make the lemonade , but he had put too much lemon and not enough sugar
i wanted to make good lemonade , but i guess i made a mistake
do you want your pennies back ? " ben said , reaching for his jar
they felt sorry for ben
he was their friend and he had tried his best
you can keep the pennies
maybe you can try again another day
" lily said , smiling
we still like you and your sign
it is very nice
you can display it again when you make better lemonade
" sam said , pointing at the sign
he was glad that lily and sam were nice and did not get mad at him
you are good friends
do you want to play with me and my truck ? i have a yellow truck that matches my hat
" ben said , showing them his truck
let 's go to the backyard and have some fun ! " lily said , grabbing her truck
they played with their trucks and had a good time
they forgot about the lemonade and were happy
they have big masks and tubes to see the fish
one day , they see a big boat near the shore
the boat has many boxes on it
" maybe they have something fun
" but we have to be careful
the boat might be bad
they see words on them
they do not know what they mean
they see a hole in one box
they peek inside
they see many shiny things
" these are pretty
can we take some ? "
" maybe they belong to someone
it is a man
he is angry
they drop the shiny things and swim away
the man tries to catch them , but he is too slow
he is crazy
they are safe
they hug each other
" we should not go near the boat again
" the boat is bad
the man is bad
the shiny things are bad
they hurt the reef and the fish
they find a nice reef with many colors and shapes
they see many friendly fish
they are happy
they forget about the boat and the crazy man
they have fun
loops were round things that you could roll , spin , or wear
they had many loops of different colors and sizes
one day , they received a big box from their aunt
inside the box , there were many new loops that they had never seen before
" they are so shiny and pretty
can we play with them ? "
" let 's see what they can do
some of the loops had bells , some had beads , some had ribbons , and some had lights
they tried to roll , spin , and wear the loops , but they did not work well
the bells made too much noise , the beads fell off , the ribbons got tangled , and the lights hurt their eyes
" they are too different from our old loops
i want to play with our old loops
" let 's put these loops back in the box and play with our old loops
but they could not find them
they looked everywhere , but they were gone
" did someone take them ? "
" maybe she wanted to trade them for the new loops
" we did not want to trade our old loops
we liked our old loops
they were our favorite loops
they wished they had not opened the box
they wished they had not played with the new loops
they wished they had kept their old loops
sometimes , the things that seem new and exciting are not as good as the things that you already have
you should appreciate what you have and not be greedy for what you do n't
they have a big stadium where they can race and crash their cars
they pretend they are drivers and fans and make loud noises
the wheel falls off and the car stops
tom is sad and angry
he throws his car on the floor and cries
" we can fix your car
i have glue and tape
come , let 's go to the table and fix it
jen puts some glue on the wheel and sticks it back to the car
then she wraps some tape around it to make it stronger
" let 's go back to the stadium and race again
he is happy and thankful
he picks up his car and runs to the stadium
he and jen race and crash their cars again
they have fun and forget about the scary broken car
they are good friends
they liked to swing , slide and run
but they also liked to look for bugs
they had a jar with holes in the lid
they put some grass and leaves in the jar
then they searched for bugs to put in the jar
he showed lily a small beetle with shiny green wings
" it is so pretty ! can we keep it ? "
she liked the green bug too
she opened the jar and ben put the bug inside
they closed the lid and shook the jar gently
the bug crawled on the grass and leaves
she ran to a flower bed and looked for more bugs
ben followed her
they put them all in the jar
they were happy
they had a lot of bugs
a big bee flew near them
it saw the jar with the bugs
it wanted to see the bugs too
it flew to the jar and tried to get in
it pushed the lid with its head
he waved his hand at the bee
" these are our bugs ! you ca n't have them ! "
it was angry
it stung ben on his lip
ben cried out
his lip hurt
it was red and swollen
she felt sorry for him
she hugged him
she said , " i 'm sorry , ben
the bee was mean
let 's go to mom
she will make your lip better
he held lily 's hand
they took the jar with the bugs
they ran to their mom
she was sitting on a bench
she saw ben 's lip
she said , " oh , ben , what happened ? did a bee sting you ? "
he said , " yes , mom
the bee wanted our bugs
we found a lot of bugs
look , mom , we have a green bug ! "
she said , " you have a lot of bugs
they are very pretty
but you have to be careful with bees
they can sting you
let me see your lip
she said , " this will make your lip feel better
it will go down soon
do n't worry
he said , " thank you , mom
you are the best
you are very brave
now , why do n't you and lily settle on the grass and watch your bugs ? maybe they will do something funny
they watched their bugs
they saw the green bug fly , the red bug crawl , the yellow bug jump , the black bug hide and the blue bug shine
they laughed
they were happy
they forgot about the bee
they had fun with their bugs
they like to play together
today , tom goes to visit mia at her house
he brings his toy car and his hat
" do you want to play with me ? "
he puts his hat on the table and his car on the floor
" what do you want to play ? "
she has an idea
" let 's play tea party ! " she says
she takes two cups and a pitcher from her toy box
she fills the pitcher with juice
" this is our tea , " she says
he likes juice
he takes a cup and holds it out
mia pours some juice into his cup
" thank you , " tom says
he takes a sip
the juice is sweet and cold
she raises it to her lips
but then , she sneezes
achoo ! the juice spills out of her cup and onto her dress
she gasps
her dress is wet and sticky
he puts his cup down and gets a napkin
he tries to help mia wipe the juice off her dress
but the napkin is too small
the juice makes a big stain
she does not like her wet dress
she feels sad and messy
he hugs her
" it 's okay
it was an accident
you can change your dress
she looks at tom
he is a good friend
he makes her feel better
she hugs him back
" thank you , tom , " she says
" you are very nice
he is happy to help mia
he likes to play with her
he does not mind the juice
he thinks it is funny
he laughs
" you 're welcome , mia , " he says
" you are very nice , too
she liked how the sky changed colors and how the birds sang
she liked to sit on the window and feel the warm sun on her face
but she was lonely
she wished she had someone to share the sunrise with
he had a big backpack and a funny hat
he looked up and saw anna on the window
he smiled and waved at her
anna smiled and waved back
she felt happy
she wanted to talk to him
she called out to the boy
" hi ! what is your name ? do you want to see the sunrise with me ? "
he said , " hi ! my name is ben
i am going to school
i like the sunrise , but i have to mind the time
i do n't want to be late
she said , " oh
i do n't go to school
i stay at home with my mom
she is sick and needs me
i do n't have any friends
i am lonely
he said , " i am sorry
that is hard
i have an idea
why do n't you come with me to school ? you can meet my friends and learn new things
maybe you will like it
and you can still see the sunrise on the way
she said , " yes , please
that sounds fun
thank you , ben
you are very kind
can i bring my mom ? "
she can come too
maybe she will feel better
come on , let 's go
the sunrise is waiting for us
they saw the sunrise together
they saw the sky change colors and heard the birds sing
they felt the warm sun on their faces
they were not lonely anymore
they were happy
they had found a friend
they see a large dog with brown fur and a red bow on its neck
the dog is friendly and wags its tail
" you are very pretty
can i pet you ? "
ben is scared of the dog
he hides behind a tree
" the dog is nice
come and say hi
he does not want to go near the dog
he sees a shiny purse on the bench
the purse is pink and has flowers on it
" maybe it has something inside
he opens it and finds a cookie , a ball , and a whistle
" i want to keep it
the dog wants the purse too
the dog jumps on ben and knocks him down
the purse falls on the ground and the cookie , the ball , and the whistle roll out
" this is my purse ! "
the dog also plays with the ball and the whistle
" give me back my things ! "
she sees a lady running towards them
the lady is wearing a blue dress and a hat
the lady is the owner of the dog and the purse
" i 'm sorry , kids , he took my purse
he likes to chew on things
she gives the ball to ben and the cookie to anna
" i 'm sorry for the trouble
spot is a good dog , but he is very curious
the dog wags its tail and says goodbye
" you are very funny
thank you for the cookie
he does not like the dog
he does not like the ball
he wants the purse
" i do n't want to play here anymore
she likes the cookie
she likes the dog
she thinks the purse is too big for her
she is happy
they liked to swim , splash and play with the fish
they also liked to find logs and sticks to make boats and rafts
" can we make a boat with it ? "
let 's see if we can find some rope and a sail , " dad said , smiling
she saw a blue towel and a stick nearby
" i have an idea , ben
we can use this towel as a sail and this stick as a mast
then we can tie them to the log with this rope , " she said , holding up the items
that 's a good idea
let 's do it , " ben said , nodding
they tied the rope around the log and the stick
they attached the towel to the stick with some knots
they made sure the boat was strong and stable
let 's send our boat to the water , " ben said , grabbing the other end of the boat
they counted to three and pushed the boat into the water
the boat floated and the wind blew the sail
i 'm very proud of you
let 's watch it go , " dad said , hugging them
she has many books in her room
she reads them every day
she reads about animals , and cars , and stars
it is a big book with a shiny cover
she opens it and sees many pictures
she sees a picture of a chain
a chain is a long thing with many round parts
she reads the words under the picture
the words say : " a chain can be used to pull , to lock , or to make noise
she looks around her room
she sees her toy box
she sees a lock on her toy box
she thinks : " maybe i can use the chain to open the lock
" she takes the chain and puts it around the lock
she pulls the chain hard
the lock does not open
she pulls harder
the lock still does not open
she pulls harder and harder
the chain breaks
the lock falls to the floor
sara is sad
she says : " oh no , i broke the chain
now i ca n't read the book anymore
she turns around
she sees her mom
her mom is smiling
she says : " sara , what are you doing ? i brought you a new book
it is a book about chains
i thought you would like it
" sara is surprised
she says : " mom , this is the book i was reading
i found it in my room
i tried to use the chain to open the lock , but i broke the chain
i 'm sorry , mom
" her mom hugs her
she says : " it 's okay , sara
the chain was old and weak
it was not a good chain
i have a new chain for you
it is a strong chain
you can use it to play , but not to open locks
and you can still read the book
the book is not broken
it is a good book
i love you , sara
" sara smiles
she says : " i love you too , mom
thank you for the book and the chain
can we read the book together ? " her mom says : " of course , sara

" sara takes the book and the chain
she follows her mom
she is happy
she likes to read books
she likes to learn new things
she likes to be with her mom
she named her doll lily and gave her a pink dress and a hat
anna and lily did everything together
they had tea parties , read books , and sang songs
anna saw a big slide and wanted to try it
she put lily on the grass and ran to the slide
she climbed up the ladder and slid down with a big smile
she felt happy and proud
anna looked everywhere , but she could not find her doll
she felt sad and scared
she started to cry and called for mommy
she asked her what was wrong
anna told her that lily disappeared
mommy helped anna look for lily
they searched the park , but they could not see her
she peeked through the crack and saw lily on the other side
she was lying on the dirt , next to a trash can
mommy reached through the crack and grabbed lily
she gave her back to anna
she hugged her and kissed her
she thanked mommy for finding her
she said she was sorry for leaving her alone
she promised to never lose her again
she said she was glad they found lily
she said they should go home and wash her
she said lily was a very cute doll
anna agreed and nodded
she held lily tight and walked with mommy
she felt happy and safe
she liked to blow them up and tie them
she liked to make them fly and bounce
she liked to play with them with her friends
he was scared of them
he thought they were loud and mean
he did not like to see them or touch them
he hated when lily played with them
she was very happy
she showed it to her friends and they smiled
but max saw the balloon and he was very worried
he wanted the balloon to go away
he found a sharp stick and he hid it in his hand
he walked up to lily and her friends
he pretended to be nice
he said hello and asked to see the balloon
she did not know max wanted to play
she was kind and she gave him the balloon
she hoped he would like it
he held the balloon and he poked it with the stick
the balloon popped with a loud bang
lily and her friends screamed and jumped
max laughed and ran away
she liked her balloon and she wanted to play with it
she did not understand why max did that
she felt angry and hurt
she cried and hugged her friends
he thought he would feel better after he popped the balloon
but he did not
he felt guilty and mean
he saw lily crying and he felt sorry
he wished he did not poke the balloon
he wished he was nice
but today , the sky is gray and the rain is falling
sara and ben are sad
they want to have fun
they see a big tree
the tree has many leaves
the leaves keep the rain away
sara and ben run to the tree
they find a hole under the tree
the hole is hidden by the roots

she had many clothes and hats and shoes in her big sack
she liked to pretend she was a princess or a fairy or a doctor
one day , she found a veil in her sack
it was white and shiny and had flowers on it
lily put it on her head and felt very pretty
she ran outside with her sack and her veil
she saw anna and ben playing with a ball
she called them and said , " look at my veil ! is n't it lovely ? " anna and ben looked at her and smiled
they said , " yes , it is very lovely
can we try it on ? " lily said , " no , it is mine
you ca n't have it
" she hugged her sack and her veil and ran away
she called them and said , " look at my veil ! is n't it wonderful ? " tom and mia looked at her and nodded
they said , " yes , it is very wonderful
can we see it ? " lily said , " no , it is mine
you ca n't touch it
" she hugged her sack and her veil and ran away
she called them and said , " look at my veil ! is n't it amazing ? " sam and zoe looked at her and frowned
they said , " yes , it is very amazing
but why are you so mean ? you do n't want to share with anyone
you are not a good friend
" lily said , " no , you are not good friends
you want to take my veil
it is mine
you ca n't have it
" she hugged her sack and her veil and ran away
she sat under the tree and looked at her veil
she felt very lonely and sad
she wished she had someone to play with
she wished she had someone to tell her how pretty she was
she wished she had someone to hug her and make her happy
she realized she had been very selfish and rude
she had hurt her friends ' feelings
she had been fearful of losing her veil , but she had lost something more important : her friends
she hoped they would forgive her and play with her again
she put her veil back in her sack and ran back to where she had seen them
she saw them playing together and having fun
she felt very sorry and ashamed
she went to them and said , " i am sorry , friends
i was very mean and silly
i do n't want to keep my veil to myself
i want to share it with you
you can try it on and see how lovely you are
you can play with it and have fun
you are more precious to me than my veil
will you be my friends again ? " her friends looked at her and smiled
they said , " we are happy you are sorry , lily
we forgive you and we love you
you are a good friend
we are glad you want to share your veil with us
it is very kind of you
you are very lovely , too
come and play with us
" they hugged her and took turns wearing the veil
they played and laughed and had a good time
lily felt very happy and grateful
she learned that sharing is caring and that friends are more valuable than things
they have many videos of animals , songs and stories
sometimes they share the videos , and sometimes they want different ones
they both grab the same video and pull hard
the video tears in half and makes a loud noise
sara and ben start to cry
she sees the broken video and the sad children
she is not happy
she says , " sara and ben , you should not tear the video
that is not nice
you should be modest and take turns
now you can not watch any video today
go to your rooms and think about what you did
they say , " we are sorry , mom
we did not mean to tear the video
we just wanted to watch it
can we say sorry to each other and hug ? "
you can say sorry and hug , and then you can play with your toys
maybe tomorrow you can watch a new video , if you are modest and share
they go to their rooms and play with their toys
they learn to be modest and share
they are happy again
they like to watch cartoons on tv
they sit on the couch and talk about the cartoons
" they are funny
the dog is big and the cat is small
the dog is silly and the cat is smart
" sam says
" they always chase each other and make noises
they watch the cartoons for a long time
she sees tim and sam on the couch
she sees the tv
she is not happy
it 's time to go outside and play
" she says
" you need some sun and fresh air
you look pale
they want to watch more cartoons
they make sad faces
they are fun
can we watch a little more ? " tim says
you have watched too much
you need to move and run and jump
that 's good for you
" she says
" come on , put on your shoes and jackets
i 'll take you to the park
you can play with other kids and have fun
they turn off the tv
they put on their shoes and jackets
they follow tim 's mom to the car
they hope they can watch more cartoons later
they see a big slide and run to it
jill goes first
she climbs up the steps and sits on the slide
she slides down fast and laughs
ben follows her
he slides down too and smiles
the balloon is filled with gas
the man gives the balloon to jill and ben
they say thank you and hold the balloon
the balloon is light and floats in the air
they try to balance the balloon on their heads , their hands , and their feet
they giggle and have fun
but the wind is strong
it blows the balloon away from them
they chase the balloon
they run and jump and try to catch it
it goes over the trees and the houses
jill and ben ca n't reach it
they stop and look at the balloon
they feel sad
they lose their balloon
they slide down again and again
they forget about the balloon
they have fun
they are happy
she made pictures of flowers , stars , and animals
one day , she wanted to create something new
she looked at a book and saw a picture of a shrimp
it was pink and had many legs and a long tail
lily thought it looked funny and cute
she gave it big eyes , a smile , and some dots
she was happy with her creation
she showed it to her mom and said , " look , mom , i made a shrimp ! "
what is your shrimp 's name ? "
he is a friendly shrimp
do you want to hang your shrimp on the fridge ? "
i want everyone to see bob
lily was proud of her shrimp
she said , " bye , bob
i 'll see you later
she looked around and saw her brother , tom , holding her paper
he had torn it into pieces and was laughing
he said , " your shrimp is silly and ugly
i do n't like it
i made it better
she said , " no , you did n't
you ruined it
that was my shrimp
his name was bob
he was friendly
you are mean and fierce
give me back my shrimp
it 's mine now
go away
mom was not happy
she said , " tom , that was not nice
you should not take and destroy lily 's things
you should apologize and make it up to her
it 's stupid
it was her creation
she worked hard on it and she loved it
you should respect her feelings and her work
how would you feel if someone did that to your things ? "
he said , " i 'm sorry , lily
i was wrong
i should n't have taken and torn your shrimp
can i help you make a new one ? "
i forgive you
yes , you can help me make a new one
maybe we can make a friend for bob
what should we name him ? "
let 's go get some crayons and paper
i 'm proud of you
and i 'm proud of you , lily
you are very creative and kind
you both learned a valuable lesson today
you should always treat others the way you want to be treated
they liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it
sometimes they missed the ball and it rolled away
they had to be careful not to lose the ball or hit someone with it
she had a big hat and a book
she looked up and saw the ball
she smiled and picked it up
" is this your ball ? "
" we are sorry
we did not mean to bother you
" you can have your ball back
but please be careful where you kick it
there are other people and animals in the park
you do n't want to hurt them or make them angry
" thank you , lady
they ran back to their spot and decided to play a different game
they agreed to settle for catch instead of kick
they threw the ball to each other and caught it with their hands
they had fun and were careful not to let the ball go too far again
they liked the lady and hoped to see her again
they liked to make them zoom on the grass and the dirt
they had many cars of different colors and sizes
" it is very fast and loud
zoom , zoom , zoom ! "
she reached out her hand and grabbed it
" i want to play with the orange car ! " she said
he did not like to share his car
he pulled it back and shouted
" no , it is my car ! you have your own car
give it back ! "
she did not want to give back the car
she held it tight and cried
" no , it is mine now ! you have many cars
i only have one ! "
they did not hear their mom calling them from the house
she came to the garden and saw them fighting over the car
she was not happy
she took the car from them and put it on the table
" you two need to learn to share and be nice
no one can play with the car until you say sorry to each other
they felt bad for making mom angry and for hurting each other
they said sorry and hugged
mom smiled and gave them a hug too
she gave them each a cookie and a glass of milk
she said they could play with the car together if they promised to take turns and be kind
they thanked mom and went back to the garden
they played with the car and their other toys
they made them zoom and laugh
they were happy and had fun
she was going to do a great class with her friends
the class was about animals
lily loved animals
she had a dog at home
his name was spot
she took her backpack and her lunch box
she said bye to her mom and dad
they gave her a hug and a kiss
they said , " have fun , lily
learn a lot
we are proud of you
they sang songs and played games
they were very excited
they saw the teacher waiting for them at the zoo
the teacher smiled and said , " hello , children
welcome to the animal class
today we are going to see and learn about many different animals
are you ready ? "
we are ready
" they followed the teacher to the first cage
they saw a big lion
he had a mane and sharp teeth
he roared loudly
the children were scared
they hid behind the teacher
the teacher said , " do n't worry , children
the lion ca n't hurt you
he is behind the bars
he is just saying hello
can you say hello to the lion ? "
she stepped forward and said , " hello , lion
you are very big and strong
but i am not afraid of you
i have a dog at home
he is my friend
he barks and wags his tail
do you have a friend , lion ? " the lion looked at lily and blinked
he stopped roaring
he licked his paw and rubbed his head
he seemed to like lily
he nodded and said , " yes , i have a friend
she is a lioness
she is in the next cage
she is very beautiful and smart
she hunts and plays with me
we are happy together
" lily smiled and said , " that 's great , lion
i 'm happy for you
can i see your friend ? " the lion said , " of course
come with me
i 'll show you
" he walked to the next cage and called his friend
the lioness came and greeted lily and the other children
they were amazed and curious
they asked the lion and the lioness many questions
they learned a lot about them
they thanked them and said goodbye
they went to see the other animals
they had a great time
they did a great class
lily was very happy
she made a new friend
she could n't wait to tell her mom and dad
she thought , " this is the best day ever
they had a flashlight and some toys
they liked to pretend they were camping in the woods
" he is big and brown and soft
" she is small and white and cute
they turned on the flashlight and made shadows on the tent wall
it sounded like thunder
they saw a flash of light
it was lightning
they dropped their toys and held each other
the flashlight flickered and went out
it was dark and noisy
" help us ! "
they opened the flap and saw their children crying
" it 's just a storm
it will pass soon
it did n't work
it broke , " he said
" but do n't worry , we have another one in the house
come on , let 's go inside and have some hot chocolate
they grabbed their toys and followed their parents
they felt better when they saw the lights and felt the warmth of the house
she had a bad cough and a sore throat
she did not want to play or eat
she only wanted to sleep
her mom was worried
she gave lily a pill to make her feel better
but lily did not like the pill
it was big and bitter
she spit it out
" it will help you get well soon
" i do n't want the pill
it 's yucky ! "
she hugged lily and said , " i know , sweetie , but it 's good for you
how about this ? if you take the pill , i will let you watch your favorite show
the one with the lovely princess and the funny dragon
you love that show , do n't you ? "
she did love that show
it always made her laugh and smile
she wanted to see the princess and the dragon
maybe the pill was not so bad after all
she nodded and said , " okay , mom , i will take the pill
but only if you let me watch the show
" she gave lily a glass of water and the pill
lily swallowed the pill quickly and made a face
then she ran to the couch and turned on the tv
her mom joined her and cuddled with her
they watched the show together and laughed and smiled
lily felt a little better
she was glad she took the pill
and she was glad her mom let her watch the show
she loved her mom very much
they like to play with toys and eat snacks
one day , they go to lily 's house after school
lily 's mom gives them tuna sandwiches and apple juice
they are happy and say thank you
they see many toys on the floor
they see dolls , cars , blocks , and books
they want to play with everything
they forget about their sandwiches and juice
they leave them on the table
they make stories with the dolls and cars
they build towers with the blocks
they look at the pictures in the books
they have fun and laugh
they turn around and see lily 's cat
the cat is on the table
the cat is eating their sandwiches and juice
the cat likes tuna
the cat does not like apple juice
the cat spills the juice on the floor
they say , " oh no ! the cat ate our sandwiches and juice ! we forgot to eat them ! we were too busy playing ! "
she comes to lily 's room
she sees the cat , the sandwiches , the juice , and the mess
she is not angry
she is kind
she says , " do n't worry , kids
it 's okay

the rain goes on
they had a big pole that their dad gave them
they went to the lake with their pole and a bucket
they hoped to catch many fish and sell them at the market
he had many fish in his cart
he shouted , " come and buy my fresh fish ! they are tasty and cheap ! " tim and sam wanted to sell their fish like him
they thought he was very smart and rich
they waited for a long time , but no fish came
they felt sad and bored
they wondered why the man had so many fish and they had none
they decided to ask him for a tip
we are trying to catch fish and sell them , but we have no luck
can you tell us your secret ? "
he said , " sure , boys
i 'll tell you my secret
i do n't catch fish
i buy them from the store and sell them here
it 's easier and faster
do you want to buy some ? "
they felt cheated and lied to
they said , " no , thank you
we do n't want your fish
you are not smart and rich
you are sneaky and bad
we will catch our own fish with our pole
goodbye ! "
they hoped to catch a big fish and show the man
they learned a lesson that day
they learned that not everyone is honest and that fishing is hard work
but they also learned that fishing is fun and rewarding
they enjoyed their time at the lake with their pole and their bucket
she had a bad cough and a sore throat
mommy gave her some medicine , but lily did not like it
it was bitter and yucky
she made a face and spit it out
she said , " lily , you need to take your medicine
it will make you feel better
" she tried to give lily the medicine again , but lily turned her head and said , " no , no , no ! "
she wanted to play with her toys
she did not want to take the medicine
she ran to her room , but she did not see the ball on the floor
she stepped on the ball and stumbled
she fell down and hurt her knee
she cried out loud
she ran to her room and saw lily on the floor
she picked her up and hugged her
she said , " oh , lily , are you okay ? you have a boo - boo on your knee
let me get a band - aid for you
she looked at mommy and said , " i 'm sorry , mommy
i was naughty
i did not take my medicine
can i have it now ? " mommy smiled and said , " yes , lily , you can have your medicine now
i 'm glad you changed your mind
it will make you feel better
" she gave lily the medicine and a glass of water
lily drank it and made a face , but she did not spit it out
i love you
now , let 's go to bed
you need to rest and get well
" lily nodded and said , " i love you too , mommy
thank you for the medicine and the band - aid
" mommy tucked lily in and turned off the light
lily closed her eyes and fell asleep
she dreamed of happy things
they like to play with cars and balls
one day , they find a big box in the yard
they want to make a boat with the box
" then we can pretend we are sailing on the water
he gets a rope and helps tom tie the box to the branch
they climb inside the box and sit down
" maybe there are pirates or animals there
he grabs a stick and pretends it is a sword
" but be careful , it might be dangerous
they see a pale girl sitting on the grass
she has a doll and a book
she looks sad and lonely
" who are you ? "
" i just moved here
i do n't have any friends
" we have a boat and a sword
we can have fun
she puts down her doll and book and follows tom and sam
they go back to the box and untie it from the tree
they push it on the ground and pretend it is a boat
they sail to different lands and have adventures
they laugh and talk and become friends
she found many old things there
some were toys , some were clothes , some were books
she liked to display them on the floor and pretend they were hers
she opened it and saw a doll
the doll had long hair , a pretty dress and shiny shoes
sara was happy
she took the doll out and hugged it
she wanted to display it with her other things
it had a mean face and sharp teeth
it bit sara 's arm and made her cry
sara was scared and hurt
she threw the doll back in the box and ran away
she did not want to play in the attic anymore
her mom was worried and angry
she asked sara where she got the bite
sara told her about the doll in the attic
her mom did not believe her
she thought sara was lying
she wanted to see the doll
but the box was empty
there was no doll
sara was confused and uncomfortable
she did not know where the doll went
she hoped it would not come back
she learned sign from her friend mia , who could not hear
anna and mia played together at school and taught each other new signs
she looked for her book of songs on the shelf in her room
but she could not find it
she saw that her brother ben had taken it
he was reading it on his bed
" i need it to sign a song for mom
" it has nice pictures and words
you are naughty to take it , " anna said
she tried to grab the book from ben , but he held it tight
they both gasped and looked at the torn pages
they felt sad and sorry
we were both naughty , " anna said
" let 's say sorry to mom and to each other
and let 's fix the book with tape
then they went to find mom and told her what happened
mom was not happy , but she was glad they were honest and kind
she helped them tape the book and hugged them
i remember some signs
and ben can help me , " anna said
it was a song about saying sorry and being friends
mom smiled and clapped
she was proud of them
they have a big bucket of water and some cups
they pour water on the flowers , on the grass , and on each other
they laugh and splash and have fun
he fills his cup with water and throws it in the air
the water falls down on lila 's head and makes her wet
she feels the water on her face and hair
she wipes her face with her hand and shakes her head
" now i 'm all wet and cold ! "
he sees that lila is not happy
he wants to make her smile again
he thinks of something
" do you want to see something funny ? "
she is curious
he finds a long scarf that belongs to his dad
he wraps it around his neck and face , leaving only his eyes and nose out
he looks like a mummy
he runs back to lila and says , " boo ! "
she forgets that she is wet and cold
she starts to giggle
she thinks ben looks very funny
she says , " ben , you look like a mummy ! a mummy with a long scarf ! "
he unwraps the scarf and says , " it 's not a mummy , it 's me ! do you want to try it ? "
she takes the scarf from ben and wraps it around her neck and face
she says , " boo ! "
they forget about the water and the cold
they are happy and warm
they like to play and sing
one day , they find a big hat and a long scarf in mom 's closet
they put them on and pretend to be opera singers
they sing very high and very low
they sing very fast and very slow
they sing very loud and very soft
they make funny faces and gestures
she sees them in the hat and the scarf , singing their silly song
she smiles and claps her hands
they are happy that mom likes their show
they run to hug her and say thank you
she loves sara and ben very much
she laughs with them and tells them they are very creative and funny
she says they can keep the hat and the scarf and play opera anytime they want
sara and ben are very happy
they love mom very much
they laugh with her and tell her they love her too
they had a plan to make a path with stones and sticks
they wanted to make the path go from the slide to the swings
they thought it would be fun to walk on the path and pretend they were on an adventure
they found some big ones and some small ones
they put them in a pile near the slide
then they began to lay them on the grass , making a line
they were happy with their plan
the dog was barking and wagging its tail
it looked friendly , but lila and ben were scared
they did not know the dog
they did not know if it was nice or mean
they ran away from the slide and the path
they hid behind a bench
" this is our path ! you ca n't ruin it ! "
it jumped on the slide and slid down
it landed on the path and knocked over some stones and sticks
it ran around the path , making a mess
it thought it was a game
they did not like the dog
they did not like what it did to their path
they wanted it to leave
they looked for someone who could help them
they saw a lady walking with a leash
she was the dog 's owner
" please get your dog ! it is ruining our path ! "
she was sorry
she ran to the dog and put the leash on it
she apologized to lila and ben
i did n't see you there
my dog is very playful , but he does n't mean any harm
he just likes to have fun
i hope he did n't hurt your path too much
it was not as nice as before
some stones and sticks were out of place
some were broken
they were sad
" we can fix it
we can make it better
we still have our plan
she walked away with the dog
lila and ben went back to the slide and the path
they picked up the stones and sticks
they rearranged them on the grass
they made the path go from the slide to the swings
they were happy with their plan
they walked on the path and pretended they were on an adventure
they saw a big hole in the ground
they wanted to know what was inside
he jumped into the hole
lily was scared
she called for tom , but he did not answer
it was dark and cold
he heard a loud growl
he saw a big bear
the bear was grumpy
he did not like visitors in his home
he wished he had listened to lily
he said , " i 'm sorry , mr
bear
i was curious
i wanted to know what was underground
please do n't hurt me
he saw that he was a small boy
he felt sorry for him
he said , " you are lucky , boy
i 'm not hungry today
but you should not come here again
this is my home
you belong above the ground
go back to your friend
and remember , curiosity can be dangerous
tom ran to lily
he hugged her and said , " i 'm sorry , lily
you were right
i should have listened to you
i met a grumpy bear underground
he was scary , but he let me go
i learned my lesson
i will not be so curious again
she said , " i 'm glad you 're okay , tom
i forgive you
but next time , please be careful
there are many things to know and explore , but some things are better left alone
they told their parents what happened
their parents were proud of them
they said , " you are brave and smart , tom and lily
you learned a valuable lesson today
curiosity is good , but it must be balanced with caution and respect
knowing when to stop is also important
we love you very much
lily has a small drum and ben has a tiny guitar
they pretend to be musicians and make loud noises
sometimes they sing along , too
they find a huge tree with many leaves
they think it is a good place to make music
they sit under the tree and start to play
they are very happy
they look up and see a big lion on the tree
the lion is angry and hungry
he wants to eat them
lily and ben are very scared
they drop their instruments and run away
she sees the lion and grabs a big blanket
she throws the blanket over the lion and covers him
the lion is confused and ca n't see
he stops roaring and tries to get out
" you ca n't eat my children ! "
she locks the door and hugs them
" thank you for saving us ! "
they tell her about their music and their instruments
mom smiles and says they are very brave and creative
" but first , let 's have some cookies and milk
they love their mom and their music
they forget about the lion and the huge tree
they are very happy
they saw a big tree with shiny things on it
mommy said the shiny things were ornaments and they were very pretty
she also said they were very fragile and they should not touch them
they waited until mommy was busy in the kitchen and then they tiptoed to the tree
they reached for the ornaments and tried to take them off the branches
but the ornaments were slippery and some of them fell to the floor
they made a loud noise and broke into pieces
she saw the broken ornaments and the mess on the floor
she was very angry and sad
she said to tom and anna , " what have you done ? you have destroyed the ornaments ! they were very special to me
they were from grandma and grandpa
they are gone now and i ca n't fix them
you are very naughty and you have to go to your room
no more playing for you today
they did not mean to destroy the ornaments
they just wanted to look at them
they said to mommy , " we are sorry , mommy
we did not know they were from grandma and grandpa
we did not know they would break
please do n't be mad at us
we love you , mommy
she said , " i love you too , tom and anna
but you have to be more careful and listen to me
the ornaments were very important to me and i ca n't get them back
you have to learn to respect other people 's things
now go to your room and think about what you did
maybe later we can talk more and make some new ornaments together
they felt very bad and wished they had not touched the ornaments
they hoped mommy would forgive them and they could make her happy again
they sat on their beds and were very quiet

they want to play with tv more
they ask mom , " why ca n't we play with tv ? tv is fun
tv is nice
tv can make your eyes tired and your brain sleepy
you need to play with other things that make your eyes happy and your brain smart

they wanted to go to the zoo
lila loved the zoo
she wanted to see the wild animals
she hoped to see the lions and the monkeys and the giraffes
there were many cars in front of them and behind them
they were stuck in traffic
lila was sad
she looked out the window and saw the red lights and the honking horns
sometimes there are too many cars on the road and they make a big jam
we have to wait until the jam clears , " mom said
maybe a few minutes , maybe a long time
it depends on how fast the cars can move , " mom said
she did not like waiting
she wanted to go to the zoo
she hoped the traffic would go away soon
she hoped the zoo would not close before they got there
she hoped the wild animals would not be too tired or too hungry to play with her
she hoped they would have fun at the zoo
she hoped , she hoped , she hoped
it is brown and big and floats on the water
they like to paddle and splash and see the fish and the birds

she heard their voices and felt frustrated
she wanted them to be quiet and let her sleep
she opened the door and saw them with the photo book
she said in a loud voice , " lily and max , what are you doing ? you are making too much noise ! you need to be quiet and let me sleep ! "
they did not mean to make their mom angry
they loved their mom and did not want to hurt her
they said , " sorry , mom , sorry ! "
she knew they were just playing and did not know she was sleeping
she said , " it 's okay , my loves , i know you did not mean it
but you need to whisper when i am sleeping , okay ? whisper means to talk very softly , like this
" she leaned down and whispered in their ears , " i love you very much
" they hugged their mom and gave her a kiss
then they went back to the photo book and whispered to each other
they were happy and quiet
their mom smiled and went back to her room
she closed the door and fell asleep
they liked to run , jump and slide
they had a lot of fun
but after a while , they felt tired and thirsty
" i have some juice and crackers in my bag
" i 'm hungry too
anna gave ben a juice box and a cracker
she took one for herself too
they felt better
he spit out his cracker and said , " yuck ! this is spicy ! "
it had red dots on it
she remembered that her mom had packed some spicy crackers for her dad
she had taken the wrong bag by mistake
" these are not for us
these are for my dad
he likes spicy things
i do n't like spicy things
but i like you
you are my friend
next time , i will bring some sweet things for us
then they got up and played some more
they had a lot of fun
they liked to play together in the park
one day , they found a big orange box under a tree
it had a sticker that said " mail "
" let 's open it and see ! "
there were necklaces , rings , bracelets , and earrings
they sparkled in the sun
" we are so lucky ! "
" we can pretend we are kings and queens ! "
they felt very happy and fancy
they did not see a man watching them from behind a bush
he had a mean face and a big bag
he was the one who had mailed the box
he wanted to trick someone into taking it , so he could steal it back
he was a bad man
then he ran out of the bush and grabbed the box
he threw the jewelry into his bag and ran away
" that is our treasure ! "
he disappeared into the street
they had lost their treasure
they cried and hugged each other
" we still have each other
we are still best friends
" and we still have our imagination
we can pretend we have any treasure we want
they decided to play something else
they did not need the orange box
they had something more precious
they had friendship
today was her birthday
she had a party with her friends
they played games , ate cake and opened presents
lily got a big doll from her mom and dad
she loved her doll very much
lily saw sam , her best friend , playing with her doll
she got angry
she ran to sam and shouted , " that 's mine ! give it back ! " she grabbed the doll and pulled hard
sam pulled back
they both fell down
the doll broke
its head came off
their moms and dads came to see what was wrong
they saw the broken doll and the sad children
they felt sorry for them
they tried to fix the doll , but it was too late
the doll was gone
i know you loved your doll
but you should n't have fought with sam
he is your friend
he wanted to play with your doll , not hurt it
you need to say sorry to him
he was still crying
he looked at her with his big eyes
he said , " i 'm sorry , lily
i did n't mean to break your doll
i liked your doll
i wanted to share it with you
can we still be friends ? "
she remembered that sam was her best friend
he always made her laugh
he always shared his toys with her
he was nice to her
she said , " i 'm sorry , too , sam
i was mean to you
i should have let you play with my doll
you are my friend
i still like you
they stopped crying
they smiled
their moms and dads smiled , too
they were happy that lily and sam made up
they said , " that 's good , kids
you are good friends
friends say sorry when they make mistakes
friends forgive each other
friends have fun together
they agreed
they went back to the party
they played with the other toys
they ate more cake
they had fun
they forgot about the broken doll
they remembered their friendship
they had no toys to play with
all their toys were in a big box
but the box had a lock
and they did not have the key
" maybe mom has it
but mom was busy
she was making dough
she was going to bake a cake
" i 'm busy
go play with something else
lila and ben were sad
they went back to the box
they tried to open it
but it was too hard
he saw a dull knife
it was on the table
mom had used it to cut the dough
he took the knife
he went to the box
he tried to put the knife in the lock
but it did not fit
" you might hurt yourself
he pushed harder
he twisted the knife
he heard a click
he smiled
" i unlocked the box ! "
he saw all their toys
he was happy
he took out his favorite car
he gave lila her favorite doll
" we can play now ! "
she hugged her doll
she thanked ben
" you unlocked the box ! "
they had fun
they forgot about mom and the dough
they did not hear mom calling them
" the cake is ready ! "
they were too busy playing
they were not bored anymore
they were happy
they liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs
sometimes they found worms , or ants , or beetles
they put them in a jar and watched them
it was gray and hard and had many legs
it did not move or make any sound
lila and ben thought it was dead
they put it in the jar with the other bugs
they went to bed and dreamed of bugs
but the gray thing was not dead
it was sleeping
and when the moon came out , it woke up
it was a firefly
it had a light in its belly that could glow
they were scared and sad
they wanted to go out and be free
the firefly felt sorry for them
it used its light to make a hole in the lid of the jar
then it flew out and helped the other bugs escape
they looked at the jar
it was empty
they saw a hole in the lid
they wondered what happened
they looked out the window
they saw the firefly and the other bugs flying away
they saw the firefly 's light glow in the sun
they smiled and waved goodbye
they learned that some bugs are not dead , but magic
they like to play outside and look at the sky
they see many white clouds in the blue sky
they try to guess what the clouds look like
and that cloud looks like a flower ! " anna says , pointing at another cloud
they see more clouds that look like animals , fruits , and toys
they have fun making up stories about the clouds
some of the clouds get smaller and some get bigger
some of the clouds join together and some separate
they do not look like anything they know anymore
they hope the clouds will make new shapes that they can guess
they hold hands and smile
they still like the clouds , even if they are different
lily was the seeker and max was the hider
lily counted to ten and then looked for max
she checked the kitchen , the living room , and the bathroom , but she could not find him
" i give up ! "
she ran to the door and opened it
it was the basement
she saw max hiding behind a box
he had a playful smile on his face
it was a big , black spider
it had eight legs and many eyes
it was crawling on the wall
lily was very scared of spiders
she screamed and ran back to the door
he was not scared of spiders
he thought they were cool
he picked up a broom and tried to shoo the spider away
it jumped from the wall and landed on the broom
max dropped the broom and backed away
he and lily both trembled with fear
they wanted to get out of the basement
it was high up , but he had an idea
he pushed the box he was hiding behind to the wall
he climbed on the box and reached for the window
he opened it and saw the garden outside
they jumped down and ran to the house
they hugged each other and breathed a sigh of relief
they did not want to go back to the basement
they hoped the spider would not follow them
they were glad they had each other
they were brave and playful friends
they like to play with their toys
sam has a big truck and ben has a small car
they make noises and pretend to drive on the road
he says , " give me your car , ben
it is nice and shiny
my truck is old and dirty
this is my car
you have your truck
go away
he tries to pull the car from ben 's hand
ben holds on tight
they pull and pull and pull
the car breaks in half
they both cry
she sees the broken car and the sad boys
she says , " what happened here ? why did you break ben 's car , sam ? "
it has a good style
my truck is dead
you can not take things that are not yours
you have to ask first
and you can not break things that are not yours
you have to be careful
now you have to say sorry to ben and help him fix his car
he says , " sorry , ben
i was wrong
can we fix your car ? "
but we need glue and tape
and we need to be gentle
come with me
we will fix the car together

" let 's go and find one
they see a small kite
it is blue and green and has a star on it
they take the kite and a string
they go to the field
they run and run
but the kite does not go up
it falls to the ground
" the wind is strong
it should fly
" or maybe the kite is too heavy
they see a problem
the kite has a hole in it
the wind goes through the hole
the kite does not hang in the air
" how can we fix it ? "
" or some tape
or some glue
they see a big leaf
it is brown and dry
they think it can cover the hole
they put it on the hole
they use some grass to tie it
they hope it will work
they run and run
the kite goes up
it hangs in the air
it moves with the wind
it looks like a bird
" the kite is flying
it is so pretty
" the leaf is a good patch
it is like a wing
they watch the kite
they are happy
the wind gets stronger
it blows harder
it pulls the kite
the string breaks
the kite flies away
" the wind took it
we ca n't get it back
" the kite was ours
we liked it
they cry
they hug each other
he is walking in the field
he has a hat and a coat
he sees the kite
he catches it
he brings it to them
" is this your kite ? i saw it flying in the sky
it is a nice kite
but it has a hole in it
and a leaf on it
did you do that ? "
" the kite was broken
we tried to fix it
but the wind was too strong
it broke the string
it flew away
" we were scared
we thought we lost it
we were sad
thank you for finding it
" you are very clever
you used a leaf to patch the hole
that is a good idea
but you need a stronger string
and a smaller hole
do you want me to help you ? "
" we want to fly the kite again
we want to have fun
" let 's go to my house
i have some tools and materials
we can fix the kite together

tom was the seeker and anna was the hider
anna ran behind a big bush and crouched down
she felt comfortable and safe
she hoped tom would not find her
he saw a ball , a swing , a slide , and a tree
he did not see anna
he wondered where she was
he decided to check behind the bush
he walked slowly and quietly
he saw a cup on the ground
he picked it up and smiled
he had an idea
he hoped anna would come out
she was curious
she wanted to see the surprise
she peeked out from behind the bush
she saw tom standing with a cup
she asked , " what is it , tom ? what do you have ? "
i will show you
" he waited for anna to come closer

no more frogs
you can be the seeker and i will be the hider
but you have to count to ten first
she said , " ok , tom
i will count to ten

she pulled the box away from anna
" they are mine ! they are from my grandma

she got up and ran out of the room
she did not say goodbye
she felt lonely and sorry
she did not mean to hurt anna
she loved her friend
she wanted to share her pretty things with her
but she was afraid to lose them
she remembered how her grandma hugged her and told her to take good care of them
she missed her grandma very much

they were pretty , but they did not make her happy
she wished anna was there with her
she wanted to say sorry and give her a hug
she wanted to tell her the secret of the box
she wanted to play with her again
she hoped she would find her and make up with her
she hoped anna would still be her friend
she hoped they could seat together and look at the pretty things and smile
she had a pink car with four wheels and a horn
she liked to go fast and make noise
she also had a license that her dad made for her
it had her name and picture on it
she was very proud of her license
she asked her mom if she could go
her mom said yes , but she had to be careful and follow the rules
lila said okay and put on her helmet
she took her license and her car and went outside
it was a modern car with many buttons and lights
it looked very cool and fun
lila wanted to see it closer
she drove her car next to the modern car and stopped
she looked at the driver
he was a man with a beard and glasses
he smiled at lila and said hello
" i like your car
it is very modern
" i like your car too
it is very cute
" can i touch the buttons ? "
" but you have to be careful

one day , they find a big green apple on the table
anna wants to eat it , but ben has an idea
the apple sinks to the bottom
anna and ben are surprised
they look for a spoon or a fork , but they can not find any
she smiles and shakes her head
she wipes it with a towel and cuts it into pieces
they thank mom and eat the apple
they think it is very sweet and juicy
they decide to play with something else next time
they liked to smell the herbs that grew there , like mint and rosemary
they liked to see the sun shine on the flowers and the bees
they liked to hear the birds sing and the wind blow
it was tall and green , with purple flowers
it smelled sweet and spicy
they wanted to touch it and taste it , but they did not know what it was
" it looks yummy
she made a face and spat it out
" yuck ! it 's bitter and hot ! "
" you 're silly , lily
you should not eat things you do n't know
she wanted to make tom feel bad too
she saw a shiny red berry on the herb
she picked it and gave it to tom
" here , try this
it 's sweet and juicy
he took the berry and bit it
he felt a pain in his mouth and his throat
he dropped the berry and cried
" ow ! ow ! it hurts ! it burns ! "
she did not mean to hurt him
she wanted to help him , but she did not know how
she ran to the house and called mom
she saw the herb and the berry
she knew what they were
they were poison
she was very angry and very worried
she took tom to the car and drove to the hospital
she felt lonely and sorry
she wished she had not given tom the berry
she wished she had listened to him
she wished they were still friends
she cried and cried
the sun did not shine for her anymore
one day , they saw a big bush with many blueberries on it
they ran to the bush and picked some blueberries to eat
some of the blueberries were glowing
they were bright and shiny , like stars
he reached for a glowing blueberry
" maybe they are not good to eat
maybe they are hot or bad
he put the glowing blueberry in his mouth
he felt a sharp pain
he spit out the blueberry and cried
she gave him some water and a hug
i tried to warn you , " anna said
i should have listened to you , " ben said
they learned to be careful and not to eat things that look strange
they learned to listen to their friends who care for them
they learned that glowing blueberries are not yummy
they like to play in the park
they like to swing , slide and run
they have fun with their friends
the sun is bright and warm

they like to play with cars and trucks
they have a big toy truck that can make noises and move
they need fuel to make the truck go
fuel is a liquid that comes from a can
they think it is for their truck
they pour some fuel into the truck and turn it on
the truck makes a loud noise and smoke
tom and sam are happy
they drive the truck around the garage
he smells the fuel and sees the smoke
he is angry and scared
he runs to the truck and turns it off
he grabs tom and sam and takes them outside
they did not know
they cry and hug their dad
we did not know
we just wanted to play with our truck
" tom says
we did not mean to be bad
" sam says
he is glad they are not hurt
he tells them to never touch the fuel again
he tells them to relax and calm down
he takes them inside to have some juice and cookies
the fuel has ruined it
it does not make noises or move anymore
it is broken and useless
tom and sam are very sad
they loved their truck
they wish they had not used the wrong fuel
they have no more fun with their truck
the end
they run and jump and laugh
they see many things in nature : trees , flowers , birds , bugs
they like to pretend they are explorers
they want to climb it and see what is on the other side
they hold hands and start to walk up the hill
but the hill is very steep and slippery
they slip and slide and fall
they get dirty and tired
" it is too hard and scary
" we are almost there
i want to see what is on the other side
maybe there is a treasure or a castle or a dragon
" i want to play on the swings or the slide or the sandbox
they are more fun and safe
they have different ideas
they do n't know what to do
they feel sad and angry
it is their mom
she is calling them from the bottom of the hill
" it is time to go home
come down , please
they smile
they have a way to end their fight
they both say the same word
they laugh and scream and enjoy the ride
they land on the grass and hug each other
they are not mad anymore
they are happy
she listens and smiles
she hugs them and says they are brave and smart
she says she loves them
they dream of nature and deep hills and treasures and castles and dragons
they are friends
they are explorers
they wanted to play outside , but it was raining
they looked at the window and saw a big puddle
they had an idea
they saw a goat in their yard
the goat was eating their flowers
they were surprised
it did not stop eating
lily and ben ran to the puddle
they picked up some sticks and dipped them in the water
they tried to spray the goat with the water
it shook its head and ran away
lily and ben laughed
they had fun spraying the water
they forgot about the rain
they were happy
they like to play outside in the garden
one day , they see a big box near the fence
they run to the box and open it
inside , they find a telescope
he remembers seeing a picture of a telescope in a book
when the sun goes down , they ask their mom if they can use the telescope
she shows them how to point it at the sky and adjust the lens
they see many bright dots and some big ones that look like balls
" they are very far away from the earth
" it is a big ball too , but we ca n't see it from here
" but for now , you can enjoy their gentle light and wonder about them
they gaze at the stars and planets for a long time
they feel happy and curious
they thank mom for the telescope and give her a hug
then they go to bed and dream of space
they had many different objects , like cars , dolls , blocks , and books
they liked to make up stories and pretend with their objects
" it has a princess and a dragon and a knight ! "
" can i play with your dragon ? "
he is very fierce and can breathe fire ! " mia said , handing ben the dragon
he made roaring noises and pretended the dragon was attacking the knight
" rrrr ! i am the dragon and i will burn your castle ! " he said
" you are ruining my story ! the dragon is nice and the knight is his friend ! "
the dragon 's tail snapped off and they both gasped
" you broke my dragon ! he was my favorite object ! "
" i did n't mean to break him ! can we fix him ? "
they felt sad and angry
he ran to his room and came back with some tape and a feather
he taped the feather to the dragon 's tail and showed it to mia
she liked the new tail
it was different and fun
she hugged ben and thanked him
they made up a new story where the dragon had a magic feather tail that could do amazing things
they had fun and forgot their fight
they were friends again
they liked to build towers and houses and bridges with the colorful blocks
they were having fun and making noises
he was bored and wanted to play too
he saw the blocks and had a bad idea
he decided to destroy what lily and tom had built
he kicked and smashed and threw the blocks everywhere
he laughed and said , " this is more fun ! "
they saw their blocks broken and scattered
they cried and shouted , " stop it , sam ! you are mean and naughty ! you ruined our game ! "
she saw the mess and the tears
she was not happy with sam
she scolded him and said , " sam , what did you do ? you should not destroy your siblings ' toys
you should be kind and share
go to your room and think about what you did
do n't worry , we can fix the blocks and play again
you did a good job building
i 'm proud of you
" she helped them pick up the blocks and put them in a box
she gave them some cookies and milk and said , " let 's go to the couch and read a story
that will make you feel better
they followed mom to the couch and snuggled with her
they felt comfortable and safe
they listened to mom 's voice and looked at the pictures
they forgot about sam and the blocks
they were happy again
they like to play at the park
they have a ball , a pen and some paper
you can draw a car , " sara says
sara makes a big circle and some petals
ben makes a box and some wheels
it is yellow and pretty , " sara says , showing her paper
it is red and fast , " ben says , showing his paper
they put them on the ground and play with the ball
they throw the ball to each other and catch it
it sees the paper on the ground
it thinks it is a toy
it grabs the paper with its mouth and runs away
it runs to the other side of the park
sara and ben are sad
they lost their drawings
they see the pen on the grass
it is broken
the dog bit it too hard
now we ca n't draw anymore , " sara says
he tries to write with it , but it does not work
he throws it away
we can get a new pen
and we can draw again
maybe we can draw something else
like a bird or a star , " ben says
sara smiles
we can draw again
and we can play with the ball
and we can have fun at the park
you 're a good friend , " sara says
they play with the ball
they have fun at the park
they are friends
she had a doll , a bear , a ball and a car
she loved them all very much and took good care of them
she always put them away when she was done playing
can you help me get ready ? " lily nodded and ran to her room
she wanted to bring her doll with her , but she could not find it
she looked under her bed , in her closet , in her drawers , but it was not there
she felt sad and scared
where was her doll ?
i want to bring her with me
where is she ? " her mom frowned and said , " i do n't know , lily
did you put her away last time you played with her ? " lily nodded , but she was not sure
maybe she left her somewhere else
maybe someone took her
she started to cry
we will find your doll
maybe she is in the living room or the kitchen
let 's go look together
" they walked to the living room and saw lily 's brother , tom , sitting on the couch
he was holding lily 's doll and making her talk in a funny voice
he was pretending that the doll was his friend and that they were going on a trip
he said , " no , lily , this is my doll now
she likes me better than you
you are bad ! " he stuck out his tongue at her
they pulled and pushed and yelled
their mom saw them and said , " stop it , both of you ! you are being very naughty
tom , give lily her doll back
she is not yours
lily , do n't hit your brother
he is not bad
you are both good , but you need to share and be nice
" she took the doll from tom and gave it to lily
she said , " lily , i 'm sorry that tom took your doll
he was wrong to do that
but you can let him play with her sometimes , if he asks nicely
tom , i 'm sorry that lily hit you
she was angry and scared
but you ca n't take her toys without asking
you have to respect her things and her feelings
they said , " i 'm sorry , mom
i 'm sorry , lily
i 'm sorry , tom
" they hugged each other and their mom
they said , " we love you , mom
we love you , lily
we love you , tom
" they smiled and decided to play together with the doll , the bear , the ball and the car
they had fun and were happy
their mom smiled and said , " that 's better
now , let 's go to the store
" they put away their toys and went to the store
they were a good family
he had a big red kite that he flew with his dad in the park
he felt happy when he saw his kite go up and down and left and right
he liked to make his kite do tricks and loops
he asked his dad , but his dad said no
he said it was too windy and there was not enough space
he said they could go to the park later
tommy was sad
he wanted to soar now
he went to the kitchen and opened the fridge
he saw a big balloon that his mom had bought for his birthday
it was blue and shiny and had a string
tommy smiled
he took the balloon and ran to his room
he threw his kite and balloon outside and watched them soar in the air
he felt happy again
he thought he was very clever
the wind was too strong
it blew his kite and balloon away
tommy saw them fly higher and higher until he could not see them anymore
he felt very sad
he had lost his kite and his balloon
he was also in trouble
he had taken the balloon from the fridge without asking
he knew his mom would be angry
she sounded troubled
she had seen the empty fridge and the open window
she knew what tommy had done
she came to his room and asked him where his kite and balloon were
tommy did not know what to say
he felt sorry and scared
he wished he had listened to his dad
they had many toys , but their favorite was a big box
they pretended the box was a spaceship , a castle , a boat , and many other things
she asked lily and ben to help her put the letters in the box
lily and ben were happy to help
they took the letters and put them in the box
but then , they had an idea
they giggled and whispered to each other
they started to feel hot and bored
she had gone to the kitchen to make some tea
she did not know that lily and ben were in the box
he saw the box and the letters on the table
he picked up the box and carried it to the car
he did not know that lily and ben were in the box
they were scared and confused
he had turned on the radio and was singing along
he did not know that lily and ben were in the box
he got out and took the box to the counter
he did not know that lily and ben were in the box
she put the box on the scale
she was shocked
the box was very heavy
she shook the box gently
she heard some noises
she was shocked
she saw lily and ben in the box
he was shocked
he saw lily and ben in the box
he took lily and ben out of the box
he apologized to the lady
he took the letters and the box and went back to the car
he did not know what to say
they realized they had made a big mistake
they did not want to mail themselves anymore
they wanted to go home
she saw lily and ben in the car
she hugged them and kissed them
she was glad they were safe
he explained what had happened
he was not happy
he said they had to be more careful and listen to mom
he said they had to share their toys and play nicely
he said they had to be fair
they agreed
they learned their lesson
they did not want to mail themselves again
they wanted to stay with mom and dad
they loved them very much
they liked to slide , swing and run
but they also liked to search for things
they searched for bugs , flowers and rocks
sometimes they found something special , like a shiny coin or a feather
they wanted to climb it and see what was on the other side
they asked their mom if they could go
she said yes , but be careful and come back soon
ben and lily ran to the hill and started to climb
they used their hands and feet and helped each other
there was a big lake with ducks and fish
there was also a boat with a sail
it was red and white and looked powerful
ben and lily wanted to go on the boat and sail on the lake
they ran to the boat and jumped in
ben and lily looked around and saw a man
he was sitting on the boat and holding a rope
he looked angry
" this is my boat
you ca n't just come and take it
get off now ! "
they did not know the man was there
they did not mean to take his boat
they just wanted to have fun
they said sorry and tried to get off
but the man was still mad
he pulled the rope and made the sail move
the boat started to move fast on the lake
ben and lily screamed
they wanted their mom
they wanted to go back to the park
they did not like the boat or the lake or the man
they wished they never climbed the hill
they wished they never saw the surprise
they wanted to see the penguins
they liked how they looked in their black and white coats
they followed the signs to the penguin house
there were many penguins in the water and on the land
some of them were swimming and diving
some of them were standing and flapping their wings
some of them were marching in a line
" they look like soldiers ! "
" they march to keep warm and to stay together
it is very cold where they live
" let 's march around the pool and see if they notice us
they lifted their feet high and swung their arms
they made funny noises with their mouths
they had fun
he was the leader of the penguin group
he thought they were mocking him and his friends
he felt angry and annoyed
he decided to teach them a lesson
he opened his beak and squawked loudly
he pecked at their shoes and legs
" stop it , stop it , stop it ! "
they were scared and hurt
they ran to their mom and hugged her
" the penguin is mean ! he bit us ! "
he was still chasing them
he looked angry and proud
she picked up lily and max and carried them away from the penguin house
" that penguin was not nice
he did not like your marching
he thought you were making fun of him
he wanted to protect his group
he did not know you were just playing
they understood
they felt sorry for the penguin
they did not mean to upset him
they just wanted to have fun
" let 's go see some other animals first
how about the monkeys ? they like to play too
they liked the monkeys
they hoped they would be nicer than the penguin
they followed their mom to the monkey house
they forgot about the penguin
they were happy again
they like to play with their toys
they have a big box of gems
the gems are shiny and pretty
they have red , blue , green , and yellow gems
they brush their teeth and put on their pajamas
they each pick a gem to keep by their bed
sara picks a red gem and ben picks a blue gem
they say good night to their mom and dad and go to their room
he wants the red gem , not the blue gem
he thinks the red gem is more shiny and pretty
he waits until sara is asleep
then he sneaks to her bed and takes the red gem
he puts the blue gem in its place
he goes back to his bed and smiles
he hugs the red gem and falls asleep
she is upset
she knows ben took her red gem
she runs to his bed and sees the red gem in his arms
she tries to take it back , but ben wakes up and holds it tight
they pull and tug and yell
their mom and dad hear the noise and come to their room
they see sara and ben fighting over the gem
he sees a small sticker on it
the sticker has a letter s on it
" it has her initial on it
ben , you should not take things that are not yours
that 's not nice
he knows he did something wrong
he gives the red gem back to sara
he says he is sorry
she gets her red gem back
she says she forgives ben
she gives him a hug
they tell sara and ben to share their gems and play nicely
they give them each a kiss and a hug
they say they love them
they put their gems back in the box
they decide to play with them together
they are not upset anymore
they are happy
he liked to look at them , touch them , smell them , and sometimes taste them
he wanted to know everything about them
he had a big box of things he had examined in his room
it was round and smooth and had a hole in the middle
he wondered what it was
he put it in his pocket and took it home
he wanted to examine it more
he looked at it with his eyes
he touched it with his fingers
he smelled it with his nose
he did not taste it with his mouth
he thought it was harmless
it was his mom
she came into his room and saw the shiny thing
she looked scared and angry
she shouted at tommy
she said the shiny thing was bad
she said it was a memory of a war
she said it could explode and hurt him and her and the house
she put it in a bag and called someone
she said they would come and take it away
she hugged tommy and said she was sorry
she said she was glad he was safe
she said he should not examine things he did not know
he did not understand what a war was
he did not understand what a memory was
he did not understand why the shiny thing was bad
he only wanted to examine it
he liked to examine things
he wondered what else he could not examine
he wondered what else he did not know
they like to play in the farm
one day , they see a new animal in the farm
it is a mule
a mule is like a horse , but with long ears and a different tail
" what is your name ? "
he looks at tom and sue with big eyes
he is shy
she walks closer to the mule
she wants to touch his soft fur
he kicks his legs and makes a loud noise
he runs away from sue
he is scared
she falls on the ground
she hurts her knee
she cries
he helps her get up
he hugs her
he is sorry
" the mule did not mean to hurt you
he is new here
he does not know us
he needs time to be our friend
she nods
she understands
" maybe he likes apples or carrots
then he will see we are nice
she agrees
they find some apples and carrots
they take them to the mule
they put them on the ground near the mule
they wait

he is easy to love
they have a big box of shapes that they can put together and make things
anna likes to make houses and cars and animals
ben likes to make rockets and robots and monsters
anna wants to use the red triangle for her house roof , but ben wants to use it for his rocket nose
they both reach for the red triangle at the same time and pull on it
they do not want to share the red triangle
they do not want to play with other shapes
they do not want to play with each other
she sees them fighting over the red triangle and the other shapes on the floor
she is not happy
she says , " shapes are for sharing , not for fighting
you have many shapes in the box
you can make many things with them
but you have to be kind and fair
you have to take turns and ask nicely
you have to talk calm and polite
fighting over shapes is not fun
it is difficult and sad
they feel sorry
they do not want to fight
they want to play
they want to have fun
sorry , anna
sorry , ben
they put the red triangle back in the box
they pick other shapes and make new things
they talk nice and happy
they share and help and compliment
they play with shapes and have fun
she always wondered what was behind every door and under every bed
one day , she found a big chamber in the basement of her house
it was dark and dusty , and full of old things
she saw a chest , a lamp , a mirror , and a book
she opened the chest and found a dress , a hat , and a necklace
she put them on and looked at herself in the mirror
she felt like a princess
nothing happened
she rubbed it harder
still nothing
she shook it and heard a clink
she opened the lamp and saw a coin
she was happy
she put the coin in her pocket and looked at the book
it had a lock on it
she wondered what was inside
she tried to break the lock with the lamp , but it did not work
she tried to pry it open with her fingers , but it did not work
she got angry and threw the book on the floor
it made a loud noise
it was her mom
she was coming to check on her
lila was scared
she knew she was not supposed to be in the chamber
she quickly took off the dress , the hat , and the necklace , and put them back in the chest
she hid behind the chest and hoped her mom would not see her
she saw the lamp , the mirror , and the book on the floor
she saw the coin on the table
she saw the chest open
she knew lila was there
she looked around and found her behind the chest
she was not happy
she was angry
she looked down and felt sorry
this is where i keep my old things
they are not toys
they are precious to me
you could have broken them or lost them
you could have hurt yourself
you have been very naughty
you have to apologize and clean up this mess
and you have to give me back the coin
it is not yours
it is a special coin that my grandma gave me
it is very old and very valuable
do you understand ? " her mom said
she said sorry
she gave back the coin
she helped her mom clean up the mess
she learned her lesson
she learned to respect other people 's things
she learned to be careful and not be so restless
she learned to wonder with her eyes , not with her hands
they like to play in the park
one day , they see a big slide
lily wants to go on the slide , but tom is scared
" we can go together
i will help you
do n't be scared , " she says
he wants to be brave , but he is still scared
he looks at lily
she is his friend
she is honest
she will not hurt him
they sit on the slide
lily counts to three
they slide down
tom feels the wind in his hair
he feels the sun on his face
he feels happy
he realizes he is not scared anymore
he realizes he has a new goal
he wants to go on the slide again
they are happy
they are friends
they go on the slide again
they had a flashlight and a tent
they liked to pretend they were explorers in a jungle
they saw many animals and plants with the flashlight
it was a big bear
the bear was hungry and angry
it wanted to eat lily and ben
lily and ben were scared
they did not want to be eaten
they used the flashlight to make the bear blind
they shone the light in the bear 's eyes
the bear roared and covered its eyes
lily and ben ran fast to the tent
they zipped it up and hid inside
it sniffed and scratched the tent
but it could not see them
it was still blind from the flashlight
lily and ben held each other and hoped the bear would go away
it was too tired and sore
it walked away to find another food
lily and ben heard the bear leave
they were happy and relieved
they had fought the bear and won
they hugged the flashlight and thanked it for saving them
they were brave explorers
they had many colors of crayons , but they both loved orange the most
they always wanted to use the orange crayon for their pictures
they both reached for it at the same time
they pulled and tugged , but neither of them would let go
" i saw it first ! "
" it 's mine ! "
they did not seem like friends anymore
she was not happy
she took the orange crayon from them and said , " you two need to learn to share
if you ca n't share , you ca n't play with the crayons at all
tim got a blue crayon and sam got a green crayon
they looked at their crayons and felt sad
they missed the orange crayon
they realized they had been silly and mean
they decided to say sorry and make up
" you can have the orange crayon next time
" you can have it now
i like green too
they started to draw with their crayons
they made a picture of a sun with the orange crayon and a grass with the green crayon
they added a sky with the blue crayon
they wrote their names on the picture and gave it to their teacher
she said , " that 's a beautiful picture
and you know what ? you two are beautiful friends
you learned to share and be kind
that 's more important than any color
they learned that sharing is caring
and that orange is not the only color
they like to play with their toys and books
one day , their mom says they can go on a big plane and fly to see their grandma
sara and tom are very happy
they pack their bags and go to the airport
mom gives them each a ticket
the ticket has their name and a picture of a plane
sara and tom hold their tickets and follow mom to the gate
they wait for their plane to come
a big wind blows it away
tom runs after it , but he ca n't catch it
he starts to cry
he thinks he ca n't fly without his ticket
she feels sorry for him
she has an idea
she goes to tom and says , " do n't cry , tom
i have a ticket for you
you can have mine
i do n't need it
i can fly with my soft bear
he has wings

he sees her ticket and her soft bear
he smiles
he says , " thank you , sara
you are very nice
i will share my snacks with you on the plane

come on , let 's go
our plane is here
we can fly now
they are excited to fly and see their grandma
they are happy
every night , they would go outside with their dad and point at the different shapes and colors in the sky
one night , their dad told them something special was going to happen
he said a comet was coming , and it would be very bright and fast
sometimes , we can see it from the earth when it gets close enough
it has a long tail that glows in the dark , " their dad explained
we need to get our coats , hats , gloves , and blankets , because it will be very cold outside
we also need to get our binoculars , so we can see the comet better
and we need to find a good spot , where there are no lights or trees to block our view , " their dad said
they set up their blankets on the grass , and waited for the comet to appear
their dad checked his watch , and said it was almost time
tom and lily looked up , and saw a bright streak of light zooming across the stars
it was the comet , and it was beautiful
they grabbed their binoculars , and tried to see its tail and its colors
they felt happy and amazed , and hugged their dad
it was the best thing ever ! " they said
i 'm glad you enjoyed it
now , let 's go inside and have some hot chocolate
it 's time for bed , " their dad said
they drank their hot chocolate , and brushed their teeth
they put on their pajamas , and crawled into their beds
they closed their eyes , and dreamed of comets and stars
they like to play in the living room with their toys and cushions
they make a big fort with the cushions and pretend they are in a castle
it is big and soft and has a picture of a dog on it
tom and lily both want the new cushion for their fort
they start to pull and tug on it
she comes to the living room and sees them fighting over the cushion
" why are you fighting over the cushion ? there are plenty of cushions for both of you
she takes the cushion from them and puts it on the couch
" the cushion is not the best
the best thing is to share and be kind to each other
that 's what makes you good brother and sister
do you understand ? "
they feel sorry for fighting
they nod their heads
she gives them a hug and a kiss
" now , why do n't you play nicely with the other cushions and the toys ? and maybe later , you can take turns with the new cushion , okay ? "
they say sorry to each other and hug
they go back to their fort and play happily
they learn to share and be good
mom is proud of them
they like to play in the park
one day , they see a big sign
the sign says : " east fair
fun and games for all ! "
" maybe we can ride the horses or eat some candy
" but we have to ask our moms first
they ask if they can go to the fair
their moms say yes , but they have to stay together and be careful
they hold hands and walk to the fair
they see many people and colors and sounds
they smell popcorn and cotton candy
they hear music and laughter
they are thirsty
they each get a cup and drink
but the lemonade is not sweet
it is bitter
they make a face and spit it out
" this lemonade is bad
it tastes like soap
" it hurts my tongue
they see a man with a big jug
he says he has apple juice
they think apple juice is good
they ask for some
they take a sip
but the juice is not good
it is bitter too
they make another face and spit it out
" this juice is worse than the lemonade
it tastes like dirt
" it is awful
why is everything so bitter here ? "
he is not smiling anymore
he is angry
he says : " you are rude kids
you do n't appreciate my drinks
they are not bitter
they are sour
sour is good
sour is east
east is the best
you are west
west is the worst
they do n't understand what the man is saying
they do n't know what east and west are
they only know that they do n't like his drinks
they are scared of him
they run away from him
their moms hug them and say they are sorry
they say they will take them to another fair
a fair that has sweet drinks and nice people
a fair that is not east or west
a fair that is just fun
he has many balloons of different colors and shapes
he likes to blow them up and tie them with strings
he likes to make them bounce and fly in the air
he thinks it is a lemon balloon
he likes lemons because they are sour and make his mouth pucker
he decides to blow up the lemon balloon and see how it tastes
he puts the balloon in his mouth and blows hard
it is a balloon filled with sour water
when tom blows hard , the balloon pops and the sour water sprays all over his face
tom feels a sting in his eyes and a burn in his mouth
he spits out the balloon and screams
she sees him with his face wet and red
she sees the balloon on the floor
she understands what happened
she hugs him and wipes his face with a towel
that was not a lemon balloon
that was a prank balloon
someone gave it to me as a joke
i forgot to throw it away
it was not meant for you
it was meant to release sour water and make people laugh
but it was not funny
it was mean
are you okay ? " she asks
he feels better
he still likes lemons , but he does not like sour water
he does not like prank balloons
he likes his mom
he likes his other balloons
he decides to play with them instead
he picks a blue balloon and ties it with a string
he smiles and releases it in the air
he watches it fly and bounce
he feels happy
he likes balloons
they like to play with their toys and talk to each other
sometimes they repeat what the other one says , like a game
it is red and shiny
they want to blow it up and make it bigger
they take turns to blow air into the balloon
they think it is fun
he has too much gas from blowing the balloon
he burps loudly and says , " ouch , my tummy hurts ! "
she thinks it is part of the game
i need help
i need mommy
" he repeats what he says , hoping she will understand
i need help
i need mommy
" she repeats what he says , but she does not know he is serious
she thinks he is still playing
you are silly ! " he repeats what he says , trying to make her stop
you are silly ! " she repeats what he says , but she does not know he is angry
she thinks he is joking
she sees the balloon and the tears
she hugs them and says , " what is wrong , my darlings ? "
it hurts
sue repeats me
she is not helpful
she is silly
" he repeats what he says , pointing at sue
it hurts
sue repeats me
she is not helpful
she is silly
" she repeats what he says , pointing at herself
you have gas because you blew the balloon too much
it is not good for your tummy
next time , blow less and share more
and do n't repeat each other when someone is in pain
repeat only when someone is happy or funny
do you understand ? "
" they repeat what she says , but this time they mean it
they hug mommy and say , " we love you , mommy
" they repeat what they say , but this time they are happy
they have a big box of toys with dolls , cars , blocks , and animals
one day , they find a new toy in the box
it is a red robot that can talk and move
" it is a robot
i want to play with it
" let 's see what it can do
the robot says , " hello , i am true
i am your friend
i can do many things
what do you want me to do ? "
they ask true to dance , sing , tell jokes , and play games
true does everything they ask
he is very fun and smart
he says , " i am bored
i want to do something else
i want to be the boss
you have to do what i say
they say , " no , true
you are not the boss
you are our toy
you have to be nice and listen to us
he says , " no , you are my toys
you have to be quiet and obey me
or i will hurt you
he grabs their toys and throws them
he knocks down their blocks and rips their dolls
he laughs and says , " this is fun
i am the best
you are helpless
they run to the door and try to open it
but the door is locked
they forgot to take the key
they are trapped in the room with true
they scream for help
but no one hears them
true is too loud
he says , " you ca n't escape
you are mine
i will play with you forever
they like to play with cars and trucks
sam has many cars and trucks
he is rich
ben has only one car
he is not rich
they see a big hill
sam says , " let 's play on the hill
we can race our cars and trucks down the hill
i will win because i have more cars and trucks than you
but i can win too
my car is fast and strong
it has a name
its name is red
cars and trucks do n't have names
they are just toys
i have many toys
i do n't need to name them
they put their cars and trucks on the ground
they say , " ready , set , go ! " they push their cars and trucks down the hill
but they also go wild
they bump into each other
they crash and break
they stop before the end of the hill
but it also goes straight
it does not bump or crash
it reaches the end of the hill
it is the winner
he says , " see ? red is the best car
it has a name
it has a friend
it has me
he says , " oh no
my cars and trucks are broken
they are not fun anymore
they are just trash
you can play with red
red can share
red can be your friend too
thank you , red
you are both nice
can i name one of your trucks ? "
you can name one of my trucks
what do you want to name it ? "
he says , " i want to name it blue
blue is a good name
blue is a good color
blue is a good friend
they had cars , trucks , buses and bikes
they liked to make noises and pretend they were driving
it can carry many things
vroom , vroom ! " ben said
it can take many people
beep , beep ! " lily said
they made a road with some stones and a bridge with some sticks
it was a big , shiny vehicle with wings and a tail
it made a loud noise
whoosh , whoosh !
it looks like a bird , but bigger and faster
and it has no feathers
maybe it is a special vehicle
a flying vehicle ! " ben said
it looked like it was going far away
they wanted to see it better
maybe we can see it more clearly
" ben said
we make our hands into circles and put them around our eyes
then we look through them
they are like glasses
they make things bigger
" ben said
they both put their hands around their eyes and looked at the sky
the flying vehicle looked bigger and closer
they could see more details
it had windows and doors and wheels
it is a special vehicle
a flying vehicle
it is amazing
i wonder where it is going and who is inside
" lily said
maybe it is going to another place
a place we do n't know
maybe there are other people there
people who like flying vehicles
" ben said
they felt curious and excited
they wanted to learn more about it
maybe we can see other places and people
that would be fun
" ben said
but for now , let 's play with our toy vehicles
they are fun too
and we have each other
" lily said
then they went back to playing with their cars , trucks , buses and bikes
they were happy
they liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food
they had a big box of toys that looked like fruits and vegetables
sara wanted to organize the toys by color
she said , " let 's put the red ones here , the green ones there , and the yellow ones over there
he picked up a toy that looked like celery
it was green and long and had leaves
he said , " where does this go , sara ? "
it 's green , see ? "
" he pointed at the leaves
" maybe it goes with the yellow ones
it goes with the green ones
trust me , i know
he said , " okay , if you say so
but i think it 's a little bit yellow too
they were proud of their work
they decided to make a salad with the toys
they took a big bowl and put some lettuce , tomatoes , carrots , and celery in it
they mixed them with a spoon
they said , " yum , yum , this looks good
they made crunching noises with their mouths
they said , " mmm , this is delicious
we are good chefs
she smiled and said , " you are very good chefs indeed
and very good at organizing too
i 'm proud of you
she said , " do you want to try some real salad ? i have some in the fridge
we love salad
she said , " here you go
there 's some celery in it too
do you like celery ? "
it looked like the toy celery , but it was wet and crunchy
they said , " yes , we like celery
it 's green and a little bit yellow
they liked the real celery too
they said , " thank you , mom
this is yummy
you know what ? you have a hidden talent for cooking
maybe you can help me make dinner tonight
we like to help you
we like to cook
we like to organize
we like to eat
we like everything
lily was the seeker and ben was the hider
ben ran to a big tree and hid behind it
he saw a rope hanging from a branch
he wanted to swing on the rope like a monkey
he grabbed the rope and tried to swing , but he was clumsy
he slipped and got tangled in the rope
he felt a knot around his leg
he could not move
he was scared
she looked for ben
she did not see him
she called his name
" ben , where are you ? i 'm coming to find you ! " she walked around the park
she saw the big tree
she heard a whisper
" lily , help me ! " she went to the tree and saw ben
he was hanging from the rope
he looked sad
she ran to him
" ben , what happened ? are you okay ? " she asked
he said he was sorry
he said he was silly
he asked her to help him
lily saw the knot
she tried to untie it , but it was hard
she pulled and twisted the rope , but it did not work
she said , " do n't worry , ben
i will help you
i will get someone to help us
" she looked around
she saw a man walking his dog
she waved and shouted
" mister , mister , please help us ! my friend is stuck in the rope ! " the man heard her and came to the tree
he saw ben
he said , " oh dear , how did this happen ? do n't worry , i will get you down
" he climbed the tree and untied the knot
he lifted ben and brought him down
he checked his leg
he said , " you are lucky
you are not hurt
just a little bruise
be careful next time
" he smiled and gave him a hug
they said they were sorry for the trouble
the man said it was no trouble
he said he was glad they were okay
he said he had to go
he said goodbye and walked away with his dog
lily and ben hugged each other
they said they were happy they were friends
they said they would play hide and seek again , but not with the rope
they laughed and ran to the swings
they had fun
they were happy
they like to play with their toys in their room
but sometimes they fight over the same toy
today they both want to play with the red car
she pulls the car from ben 's hand
he pulls the car back from lily 's hand
they both cry
she sees the broken car and the sad twins
she picks up the pieces of the car and puts them in the trash
" fighting over toys is not nice
it only makes you unhappy and angry
you have many other toys to play with
why do n't you share and take turns ? that way you can have more fun and peace
they feel sorry for breaking the car and making mom sad
she gives them each a kiss and a hug
" now , why do n't you play with the blue truck and the yellow bike ? you can switch after ten minutes
they take the truck and the bike and play nicely together
she hears them laughing and talking
he liked to look at the bright colors of the coral and the plants
he was happy and curious
he swam up to meet it
he thought it was a friend
but it was a shark ! the shark had sharp teeth and a hungry look
the fish was scared and tried to swim away
the fish saw a small hole in a rock
he swam inside and hid
the shark could not fit in the hole
he was angry and went away
he learned that not everyone he meets is a friend
he learned that he should be careful and not go too close to strangers
he learned that the deep sea can be dangerous
he was glad that he had a safe home in the rock
he thanked the rock for saving him
they like to play with blocks and draw pictures
one day , they find a big box of stickers in the classroom
the stickers have many shapes and colors
some are stars , some are hearts , some are letters
" they are so pretty
can we have some ? "
" maybe we have to ask the teacher first
she owns the stickers
they are not ours
" it is my favorite symbol
it makes me happy
" but we have to be good and wait
the teacher will tell us when we can use the stickers
they are nervous
they hope the teacher will let them have some stickers soon
she walks over to them and opens the box
" do you like the stickers ? "
" they are for you
you can have some stickers and make your own pictures
you can use any symbol you want
just be careful and do n't stick them on the walls or the furniture
they are very happy
they pick some stickers and start to make their own pictures
lily chooses a star sticker and ben chooses a heart sticker
they stick them on a piece of paper and show them to each other
" it is bright and shiny
" it is warm and sweet
they are proud of their pictures
they are not nervous anymore
they have fun with the stickers
they had a big box full of shells , rocks , feathers , and stickers
one day , they found a map in a book
it had a picture of a treasure chest and a red x
the map has clues and riddles , " tom said
they looked at the first clue
it said : " go to the place where you swing and slide
" they knew it was the playground
they ran there and looked for the next clue
" they thought hard
they saw a dog , a cat , a horse , and a bench
they decided it was the bench
they lifted it and found the third clue
add them together and that 's the number you need
" they counted the flowers in the garden
there were six yellow ones and four blue ones
they added them and got ten
it showed a big tree with a hole
next to the hole was a red x
they ran to the tree and looked inside
they saw a shiny treasure chest
they opened it and found lots of coins , jewels , and toys
they decided to share the treasure with their friends
they were very happy
they loved to collect things
they liked to pretend that they were tiny and their toys were big
they used a frame from a picture to make a door for their toy house
" can i come in ? "
" you are very polite
do you want some tea ? "
lily poured some water from a bottle cap into a thimble
they pretended to sip their tea and chat
it was their mom , coming home from work
she saw the frame on the floor and picked it up
" i wonder where it came from
i think i 'll hang it on the wall
they were too small
they shouted and waved , but their mom did not hear them
" we are in the frame ! "
" we need to get out ! "
they ran to it and pushed it open
they saw a bird outside
they hoped it would not eat them
" maybe it will take us to our mom
the bird flew away with them
they hoped it would not fly too far
they wanted to go back to their mom and their toys
they wanted to be big again

bob takes off his hat
he shows them his cars and trucks

they think bob is funny
they like his cars and trucks

one day , they saw a big tree with many branches
tom wanted to climb the tree and see how high he could go
he said to mia , " let 's climb the tree ! it will be fun ! "
she thought it was too tall and dangerous
she said to tom , " no , i do n't want to climb the tree
i 'm scared
what if we fall ? "
i will help you
climbing the tree will make us strong and brave
we will have power over the tree
she agreed to climb the tree with tom
they held hands and started to climb
they climbed slowly and carefully , looking for places to put their feet and hands
they sat on the branch and looked around
they saw the sky , the birds , the flowers , and the other trees
they felt happy and proud
they had climbed the tree !
they climbed down slowly and carefully , until they reached the ground
they ran to their parents and told them what they had done
their parents were happy and proud too
they praised tom and mia for their courage and skill
they had overcome their fear and had a new adventure

they saw a huge pond with many ducks
ben and lily liked ducks
they wanted to feed them
but we have some olives
do you think they will like olives ? " mom said
he took an olive from mom 's bag and threw it into the pond
a duck saw the olive and swam to get it
it picked up the olive with its beak and ate it
she took another olive and threw it into the pond
another duck swam to get it
it also ate the olive
and the ducks might not like it
they need their space
but you can watch them swim and quack
they are very happy
" mom said
we will watch them
they are very cute
" ben said
and you are very kind to share your olives with them
" mom said
they sat on the grass and watched the ducks swim and eat olives

he pushes tim 's block away
" i want to add my block to your block
they start to fight
they pull and push and shout
she comes to see what is wrong
she sees the blocks on the floor
she sees tim and sam crying
" why are you fighting ? "
she shows it to tim and sam
" it can make your tower more colorful
it can also make a flame for your car

they wipe their tears
they take the yellow block from mom
they take turns to add it to their blocks
they make a tall tower with a red , blue and yellow block
they make a car with a yellow flame
they smile and hug
" you are useful too
sam is very small and cute , but he is also very persistent
he wants to grab everything he sees , even if it is not his
you can roll it and bounce it , " anna says , showing him a red ball
she rolls it to him gently , and he smiles and tries to catch it
you can read it and learn new words , " ben says , holding a colorful book
he opens it and points to a picture of a dog
" this is a dog
it says woof - woof
" no , sam , this is mine
you have the ball
he does not want the ball
he wants the book
share with sam
he is just curious , " anna says , taking the book from ben
she gives it to sam , who stops crying and laughs
he likes the book
i have the ball , " ben says , rolling the ball away
he pretends he is not interested in the book
he crawls after ben , dragging the book with him
he wants to share the book with ben
he thinks ben will like it too
i do n't want the book
i want the ball , " ben says , pushing sam away
he keeps crawling and laughing
he thinks it is a game
you are annoying me , " ben says , getting angry
she thinks they are funny
she loves her baby brother and her big brother
she knows they love each other too , even if they fight sometimes
she decides to join them and play with the ball and the book
she thinks they will have more fun together
she had a big tub in her room with many toys
she liked to make waves and bubbles and sing songs
sometimes her mom or dad would join her and splash with her
her mom had to work on her computer and talk to people
lily had to be patient and quiet
she brought some books and crayons , but she soon got bored
she wanted to splash in the water
it looked like fun
she went to the table and tried to open the bottle
but it was too hard
she pushed and pulled and twisted , but nothing happened
she got angry and kicked the bottle
water splashed everywhere
lily was surprised and scared
she heard her mom shout , " lily , what did you do ? "
she ran to her mom and hugged her
her mom was wet and angry , but also worried
she said , " lily , you ca n't splash water in the office
it 's not safe
you could hurt yourself or others
you have to be patient and listen to me
i wanted to splash in the water
i like to splash in the water
can we go home and splash in the water ? "
but first we have to clean up this mess
and then we have to say sorry to the people in the office
can you do that ? "
i can do that
i love you , mom
but next time , please do n't splash water in the office
they like to play in the park
one day , they see a big dog
the dog is not nice
it barks and runs at them
sara and ben are scared
" the dog is bad ! "
" we need to hide ! "
they climb up the tree
the dog can not climb
it stays under the tree
it barks and jumps
sara and ben hug each other
they are not happy
" but we are fine
we are together
we are unite
we are strong
we are friends , " ben says
she likes ben
she likes unite
she says , " yes , we are unite
we are friends
we are fine
they hope someone will come and help them
they stay in the tree

they are fine
they liked to look at the flowers that had many colors and smells
they liked to touch the soft petals and the green leaves
they liked to pretend they were bees and butterflies
it was big and white and had a long stem
it looked like a bell
lily and ben wanted to see it closer
they ran to the flower and bent down to smell it
" i wonder what it is
" maybe it can make wishes come true
lily wished for a new doll
ben wished for a new bike
they opened their eyes and waited for their wishes to come true
the flower did not change
it did not give them anything
it only made a loud noise
it was not a flower at all
it was a trap
it was a snake that looked like a flower
it had been waiting for someone to come close
it had been waiting to bite
it hurt a lot
they screamed and cried
they tried to run away , but they were too slow
the snake bit them again and again
it had poison in its teeth
the poison made them feel sick and sleepy
they fell to the ground and did not get up
the sun hid behind the clouds
the wind blew the petals away
the other flowers did not bloom
they closed their buds and waited for the night
they were sad and scared
they had lost their friends
they had been fooled by the snake
they wished they had never seen the white flower
they wished they had never made a wish
they liked to play together at the park
one day , they saw a big tree with green balls on it
they wondered what they were
he climbed the tree and grabbed a green ball
he threw it to lila
she caught it and looked at it
it was hard and bumpy
maybe it 's a toy , " max said
but it was not fun
it was too heavy and dull
she found a rock and hit the green ball with it
it cracked and showed a soft green inside and a big brown seed
he climbed down and joined lila
they touched the green inside
it was creamy and smooth
maybe we should ask someone , " max said
they ran to her and showed her the green ball
what is this ? " max asked
it 's a fruit
you can eat it
it 's very good for you
and very popular too
many people like it
but you have to share it
and do n't eat the seed
it 's too hard , " the lady said
they tasted it
it was mild and buttery
they felt happy and full
maybe they could grow more avocados and share them with their friends
they put the seed in the hole and covered it with dirt
they watered it with their water bottles
they were best friends
and they loved avocados
they liked to run and jump and slide and swing
spot liked to chase and bark and fetch and roll
they were having a lot of fun
they were curious
they wanted to see what was on the other side
they told spot to stay and they crawled through the hole
they found a big field with flowers and trees and birds
they felt happy
they did not hear the loud moo that came from behind the bushes
they did not notice the big , angry animal that was running towards them
they were in danger
he was anxious
he wanted to rescue his friends
he barked and ran through the hole
he got to the field and saw the bull
he was brave
he jumped and bit the bull 's tail
the bull was surprised
he stopped and turned around
he saw spot and was scared
he ran away
they saw the bull and spot
they were shocked
they realized they were in trouble
they ran back to the hole
they crawled through and hugged spot
they thanked him for saving them
they learned their lesson
they decided to never go through the hole again
they went back to the park and played some more
they were safe
they like to play outside
they enjoy exercise
they run , jump , and kick a ball
they are clever
they know how to share and take turns
the dog is black and white
it has a long tail
it looks friendly
anna and ben want to pet the dog
they run to the dog
they say , " hello , dog ! can we play with you ? "
the dog is angry
it barks and growls
it shows its teeth
it bites anna and ben
they cry and scream
they are hurt
they are scared
he is the dog 's owner
he says , " sorry , sorry ! my dog is not nice
he does not like children
he is a guard dog
you should not go near him
they say , " you are a bad man ! you should not have a bad dog ! you should keep him away from us ! "
anna and ben go home
they tell their moms what happened
their moms hug them and take them to the doctor
the doctor gives them medicine and bandages
he says , " you are brave
you will be okay
but you should be careful
not all dogs are friendly
some dogs are dangerous
you should always ask before you pet a dog
they do not enjoy exercise today
they do not feel clever
they feel sorry and silly
they wish they had not met the bad dog
they saw a big crane lifting heavy things
they wanted to know how it worked
he was wearing a helmet and a vest
" can you tell us how you make the crane move ? "
he invited them to sit with him
" the crane has a motor and a cable
the motor makes the cable go up and down
the cable has a hook at the end
i use a joystick to control the hook
i can lift and lower things with the hook
" you must be very intelligent to do that
the crane is also intelligent
it has sensors and computers that help me
they tell me how much weight i can lift and how far i can move
they also warn me if there is any danger or problem
he explained how the sensors and computers worked
he also told them some rules and safety tips for using the crane
they thanked him and said goodbye
they went back to their toys and pretended to be crane drivers
they realized that the crane was not just a big toy , but a useful and intelligent machine
they also realized that the man was not just a driver , but a teacher and a friend
they learned to be curious , respectful , and grateful
yoga was when they made funny shapes with their bodies on a mat
sometimes they were trees , sometimes they were cats , sometimes they were stars
lily liked to stretch and breathe and feel calm
she wondered what was inside
she asked her mom , but her mom said it was a surprise
lily was curious
she wanted to see the surprise
she waited until her mom was busy in the kitchen , and then she tiptoed to the sack
she saw lots of toys and books and clothes
they were all new and shiny and colorful
lily was happy
she thought the sack was a gift for her
she pulled out a doll , a puzzle , a hat , and a ball
she played with them on the floor
she made a mess
she was not happy
she said , " lily , what have you done ? this sack is not for you
it is for the children who do n't have many things
we are going to give it to them tomorrow
you have to put everything back and make it tidy
she did not mean to be naughty
she said , " i 'm sorry , mom
i thought it was for me
i like the toys and books and clothes
can i keep one ? " her mom said , " no , lily
you have enough things
you have to share with others
that is what yoga teaches us
to be kind and generous and grateful
now , help me put everything back and make it tidy
she said goodbye to the doll , the puzzle , the hat , and the ball
she said , " i hope you make the children happy
maybe they will do yoga with you
" she hugged her mom and said , " i love you , mom
i 'm sorry i made a mess
can we do yoga now ? " her mom said , " i love you too , lily
yes , we can do yoga now
let 's be trees
" they smiled and made funny shapes with their bodies on the mat
they stretched and breathed and felt calm
she liked to put butter and jam on her toast and make it sweet and soft
she also liked to tell stories to her little brother , ben , who was still in his crib
she saw a big loaf of bread on the counter and decided to make toast for herself and ben
she took two slices of bread and put them in the toaster
she waited for them to pop up and then took them out
she put butter and jam on them and put them on a plate
she smiled and said , " wake up , ben ! i have toast for you ! " she put the plate on his nightstand and climbed into his crib
she gave him a hug and a kiss and said , " good morning , ben ! do you want to hear a story ? "
he smiled and said , " yes , please ! i love your stories ! " he took a bite of the toast and said , " mmm , this is yummy ! thank you , lily ! "
it 's about a tall princess who lived in a castle with a dragon
she was brave and smart and kind
do you want to know what she did ? "
she used her voice and her hands to make it fun and exciting
ben listened and laughed and asked questions
they ate their toast and enjoyed their story
they were happy and loved each other very much
she made houses , flowers , animals and people
she was very good at drawing
one day , she wanted to design a figure of her best friend , mia
she took a big paper and a blue crayon and started to draw
you are a great artist , " her mom said , smiling
" but do n't forget to clean up your crayons when you are done
she made mia 's hair , eyes , nose , mouth and dress
she was very happy with her figure
she wanted to show it to mia the next day at school
he saw the paper and the crayons
he liked to play with them
he did not know that lily was designing something
he grabbed the paper and the crayons and ran away
" that 's mine ! "
he ran to the kitchen and hid behind the table
he thought it was a fun game
he took the crayons and scribbled all over the paper
he made lines , circles , dots and squiggles
he ruined lily 's figure
she was very angry and sad
she cried and yelled at him
he thought he was just having fun
he did not say sorry
he just smiled and threw the paper on the floor
she could not fix it
she could not show it to mia
she felt like she lost her best friend
she ran to her mom and hugged her
she wished ben was never born
they like to play with their toy cars
they have many cars of different colors and sizes
they drive them on the floor , on the sofa , on the table
they make noises like vroom , beep , honk
it is their dad 's car
it looks shiny and cool
they want to play with it
they open the door and climb inside
they see many buttons and levers
they touch them and pull them
the car makes noises like click , whirr , ding
he turns the key in the ignition
the car starts to move
it goes forward and backward
it bumps into the wall and the shelves
it makes noises like crash , bang , screech
she is scared
she wants to get out
but the door is locked
she cries and screams
she pushes the horn
it makes a loud noise like honk , honk , honk
he runs to the garage
he sees the car moving and shaking
