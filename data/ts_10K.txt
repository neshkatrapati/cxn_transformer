Tom and Lily liked to play near the station
They saw big trains and cars and people
They liked the noise and the colors
Sometimes they found things on the ground , like cans and coins and papers
They liked to lift them and look at them
One day , they saw a big box near the station
It was brown and had a red sign on it
They did not know what the sign meant
They thought it was a picture of a flower
They wanted to see what was in the box
They ran to the box and tried to lift it
But the box was not harmless
It was a bomb
It had a timer and a wire
When Tom and Lily lifted the box , they moved the wire
The bomb made a loud beep and then a big boom

They might be harmful and hurt you and others
Listen to the signs and the people who know better
Be careful and safe when you play
